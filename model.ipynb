       "Row(Presidents='bush', Party_Affliation='Republican', variable='Speech1', value='\"LEHRER On behalf of Commission on Presidential Debates am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of 1988 campaign I\\'m Jim Lehrer of MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour My colleagues on panel are John Mashek of Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News For next 90 minutes we will be questioning candidates for of United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of two candidates The candidates are Vice George Bush Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis Democratic nominee LEHRER Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters The first question by agreement between two candidates goes to Vice Bush It is a domestic question You have two minutes for an answer sir The polls say number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs? BUSH think we\\'ve seen a deterioration of values think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned For a while as recall even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs and think that\\'s all wrong So we\\'ve seen a deterioration in values and one of things that think we should do about in terms of cause is to instill values into young people in our schools We got away we got into this feeling that value-free education was thing And don\\'t believe that at all do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use And of course as far as how we make better yes we can do better on interdiction But we\\'ve got to do a lot better on education and we have to do be tougher on those who commcrimes We\\'ve got to get after users more We have to change this whole culture You know saw a movie Crocodile Dundee And saw cocaine scene treated with humor as though this was a humorous little incident And it\\'s bad Everybody ought to be in this thing Entertainment industry people involved in schools education And isn\\'t a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem But we have got to instill values in these young people And have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what would do as of United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in neighborhoods But think we\\'re all in this together and my plea to American people is values in schools LEHRER Governor you have one minute to respond DUKAKIS agree with Bush that values are important But it\\'s important that our leaders demonstrate those values from top That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves Here we are with a government that\\'s been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator We\\'ve been dealing with him; he\\'s been dealing drugs to our kids Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with consequences remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call Governor\\'s Alliance Against Drugs and a young 16-year-old girl coming up to me desperate addicted dependent saying Governor need help We\\'re providing that young woman with help But want to be a of United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator that we never again funnel aid to contras through convicted drug dealers Values begin at top in White House Those are values want to bring to presidency and to White House beginning in January of 1989 LEHRER Governor a follow-up question You have two minutes to answer Are you suggesting sir that Reagan is one of causes of drug problem in this country? DUKAKIS I\\'m saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership Jim have a special responsibility not only to come up with programs and have outlined in detail very important very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention And Bush is right -- two go hand in hand But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking if we don\\'t understand that that sends out a very very bad message to our young people it\\'s a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that talked about and to young people like her all over country and say to them we want to help you Now I\\'ve outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad doubling number of drug enforcement agents having a hemispheric summsoon after 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together But we also have to take demand seriously You know we have 5 percent of world\\'s population in this country We\\'re consuming 50 percent of world\\'s cocaine And in my state I\\'m proud to say we\\'ve organized a drug education and prevention program which Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for country We\\'re helping youngsters; we\\'re reaching out to them And we\\'re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state and that\\'s kind of effort we need in every elementary school in United States of America And we\\'ve got to begin early in first second and third grade before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very very dangerous substances guess question would ask of Bush is how we instill those values how we create this environment for drug free schools that we want in this country If he or representatives of administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy or don\\'t pursue that connection in a way that makes possible for us to cut off and to be an example to our kids all over country LEHRER A minute to rebut Vice BUSH Well other day my opponent was given a briefing by CIA asked for and received same briefing am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information And what I\\'m about to say is unclassified Seven administrations were dealing with Noriega It was Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice And as governor of Massachusetts knows there was no evidence that governor -- that Noriega was involved in drugs no hard evidence until we indicted him And so think it\\'s about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective Panama is a friendly country went down there and talked to of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering and Noriega was there but there was no evidence at that time and when evidence was there we indicted him And we want to bring him to justice And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations LEHRER All right next question will be asked by John Mashek It goes to Governor Dukakis and you\\'ll have two minutes to answer MASHEK Governor Dukakis another troublesome issue for voters this year is bulging federal defic In a Dukakis administration you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficdown? DUKAKIS Yes I\\'ve been very specific about those John And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficdown because as a chief executive that\\'s balanced ten budgets in a row I\\'ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices First I\\'ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\\'t need and we can\\'t afford Bush has been critical of me for that but think those are kinds of tough choices you have to make I\\'ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on and I\\'ve outlined those in detail Secondly we\\'ve got to invest in economic growth in this country in every part of this country Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that defic Thirdly we have to bring interest rates down and we will as we come up with a good solid plan with Congress for bringing that deficdown And finally we\\'ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\\'t being paid to this country It\\'s very unfair to average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permthese monies to go uncollected I\\'ve also suggested that on domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20 to $25 billion a year which is what we\\'ve been doing under this administration We can help people to live better lives and at same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare and to become productive citizens again The thing don\\'t understand about Bush\\'s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficdown given what he says he wants to do He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\\'s against new taxes although he\\'s broken that pledge at least times in last year that know of; he wants to give wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs If he keeps this up he\\'s going to be Joe Isuzu of American politics DUKAKIS But hope you won\\'t take my five seconds away from me will say this -- LEHRER Your two minutes is up Governor DUKAKIS If he\\'s serious about what he\\'s saying then only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid Social Security Trust Fund and he tried that in 1985 and think he\\'s going to try again LEHRER You have a minute to rebut BUSH Is this time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor Let me help Governor There are so many things there don\\'t quite know where to begin When you cut capital gains you put people to work John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains Paul Tsongas a liberal senator from Massachusetts said dumbest thing did was to oppose capital gains cut It\\'s not going to cost government money It\\'s going to increase revenues to federal government and it\\'s going to create jobs So that\\'s one of things that think makes a big difference between us Massachusetts doesn\\'t have an enormous defense budget but nevertheless governor raised taxes five different times That happens to be a fact And so let\\'s kind of stay on issue and have made a specific proposal for what call a flexible freeze And permits -- economists on East Coast and West think it\\'s good -- permits to sort out priorities and we continue to grow because will not raise taxes LEHRER Your time is up too A follow-up John MASHEK Vice you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at same time you\\'ve proposed this capital gains cut you\\'ve proposed more incentive breaks for oil industry You\\'ve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in defic Is deficno longer really a concern of yours Republican Party or taxpayers? BUSH think it\\'s Republican Party and my concern to bring down And presidential leadership that want to provide in this area will bring down but we\\'ve got to get Democrats -- Congress under control They do all spending they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime I\\'d like to ask Governor to join in getting for what 43 governors have line-item veto He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso would like a balanced budget amendment But dynamics of economy -- we cut taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years So problem is -- it\\'s not that working is being taxed too little or person working out -- woman working in some factory being taxed too little It is that we are continuing to spend too much So my formula says grow at rate of inflation Perm to set priorities on where we do spending And remember federal defichas come down $70 billion in one year in 1987 And if we -- and -- actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling growth of spending Spending was only up something like 4 percent So isn\\'t that we\\'re taking too little -- from taxpayer -- we\\'re spending too much still And formula I\\'ve given you works we\\'ve put through a good economic model we\\'ve got good economists on West Coast Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who\\'s a very respected economist in -- Massachusetts And they agree that if we can do what I\\'ve said we can get down without going and socking American taxpayer once again Capital gains one more point on that please let\\'s learn from history A capital gains differential will increase jobs increase risk taking increase revenues to federal government LEHRER Governor you have a minute to rebut DUKAKIS Well hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be of United States listen to Vice very carefully What he\\'s proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in federal debt in course of past eight years an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years is a tax cut for wealthiest 1 percent of people in this country an average of about $30 000 that we\\'re going to give to people making $200 000 a year Why that\\'s more than average teacher makes We\\'ve had enough of that ladies and gentlemen We\\'ve run up more debt in last eight years than under all Presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined It\\'s time for a chief executive who can make tough choices can work with Congress can get that deficdown and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country LEHRER All right next question will be asked by Anne Groer and will go Vice You have two minutes to answer sir GROER Vice you\\'ve said you want a kinder gentler presidency one that helps less fortunate Today 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it? BUSH One thing will not do is sock every business in country and thus throw some people out of work want to keep this economic recovery going More Americans at work today than any time in history a greater percentage of work force What will do is permpeople to buy into Medicaid believe that\\'s answer am proud to have been part of an administration that past first catastrophic health bill And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to very kind of people we\\'re talking about here But we\\'ve got to keep going forward without killing off engine and throwing people out of work So answer lies seems to me in full enforcement of catastrophic program It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then also -- do not want to see us mandate across board that every company has to do this because really think that marginal operators are going to go say \"\"We can\\'t make \"\" And think then you\\'re going to see that people are put out of work All these programs -- and this cost on his -- is -- was -- saw an estimate I\\'d love to know what he thinks $35 -- $40 billion -- and seems to me that somebody pays that There isn\\'t any such thing as something free out there It either gets passed along as increased prices or gets passed along by people being put out of work so business can continue to compete So think we ought to do in Medicaid system think we ought to do by full enforcement of catastrophic health insurance think we ought to do by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience It\\'s a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance But just don\\'t want to mandate and risk putting this -- setting recovery back LEHRER A rebuttal Governor? DUKAKIS But George that\\'s no answer BUSH You don\\'t like answer but it\\'s an answer DUKAKIS Well no it\\'s no answer to those 37 million people most of them members of working families who don\\'t have a dime of health insurance and don\\'t know how to pay bills if their kids get sick at night was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens working citizens All of them with little or no health insurance One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance Has an 11-year-old son and can\\'t let that son compete in sports and Little League because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt and he won\\'t be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills My state just became only state in nation to provide for universal health care and we did with support of business community and labor and health care community and with virtually everybody in state The fact of matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying freight because they\\'re paying for those who aren\\'t And think it\\'s time that when you got a job in this country came with health insurance That\\'s way we\\'re going to provide basic health security for all of citizens of this country of ours LEHRER Follow-up Anne? GROER Yes Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by Vice and you have defended in this way would like to move on to perhaps one of most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS In -- at end of September thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT which is only Federally approved drug for treatment of disease Now I\\'d like to now sir if -- what your position is on extending that and what is you think government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease DUKAKIS Well Anne let me just say before answer your question that didn\\'t know that Vice attacked our program in Massachusetts hope he hasn\\'t Because has won support of a great many people all over state and think it\\'s a model for what hope we can do across country But when proposed my plan this past Tuesday he or one of his spokesmen called socialized medicine The last time Vice used that phrase suspect he remembers don\\'t you? It was in 1964 and that\\'s what he called Medicare Well he was wrong then and he\\'s wrong now LEHRER If may interrupt at this point and caution audience as did before we went on air please hold down You\\'re only taking time away from your candidate when you do that Governor continue please DUKAKIS Let me say this about AIDS It\\'s single most important public health crisis single most important public health emergency we\\'ve had in our lifetimes and think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through Congress which will commthis nation to resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for victims of AIDS think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and think FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January And would encourage current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it\\'s appropriate and where it\\'s done carefully and responsibly But we have not had kind of leadership we should have had In this particular area think Vice and are in general agreement on what we have to do The special federal commission made good solid recommendations think we\\'re both supportive of them and would strongly lead in that area as have in my state as Governor LEHRER Vice a minute of rebuttal BUSH Well we\\'re on right track The NIH is doing a good job in research The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging proper kind of education notice that Governor did not mention any testing But we got to have a knowledge base Testing should be confidential but we have to have a knowledge We can\\'t simply stick our heads in sands in terms of testing I\\'m chairman of President\\'s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help And you got to be careful here because there\\'s a safety factor but think these things -- and then also am one who believes we\\'ve got to go extra mile in clean -- being sure that that blood supply is pure We cannot have a lack of confidence in blood supply when comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature So research speeding drugs to market testing blood supply are very important elements of this LEHRER Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings It goes to Governor JENNINGS Vice Governor Governor one theme that keeps coming up about way you govern -- you\\'ve both mentioned leadership tonight so I\\'d like to stay with that for a second The theme that keeps coming up about way you govern is passionless technocratic -- DUKAKIS Passionless? JENNINGS Passionless technocratic smartest clerk in world Your critics maintain that in 1960s your public passion was not war in Vietnam or civil rights but no fault auto insurance And they say in 1970s you played virtually no role in painful busing crisis in Boston Given fact that a must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion We need to know if this is a fair portraof your governing or if is a stereotype And if isn\\'t fair give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a needs? DUKAKIS Peter care deeply about people all people working people working families people all over this country who in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck in other cases are having a hard time opening up door of college opportunity to their children in other cases don\\'t have basic health insurance which for most of us we accept as a matter of course and assume we\\'re going to have in order to pay bills that we incur when we get sick I\\'m somebody who believes deeply in genuine opportunity for every single citizen in this country and that\\'s kind of passion brought to my state was a leader in civil rights movement in my state and in my legislature cared very deeply about that war in Vietnam thought was a mistake thought was wrong And was one of few legislators early in that war that took a stand against war think was right stand at time and think history has proved us to be correct But have learned over time served one term was defeated as you know and defeat sometimes is an important lesson think I\\'m a much better Governor today think I\\'m a much better person a much better listener think I\\'ll be a much better for having gone through that experience But things that we have done in my state to bring opportunity to people on public assistance -- over 50 000 families on welfare that we\\'ve helped to move from welfare to work and to become productive citizens The universal health care bill that we just talked about which will guarantee health care for all of our citizens opening up of opportunity to minorities in my state affirmative action minority contracting fact that we have a 3 percent unemployment rate and more jobs than people to fill them which gives us a tremendous opportunity to reach out to everybody and make them a part of this wonderful nation of ours with opportunity that we create These are things that believe in very very deeply may be a little calmer than some about may be a greater consensus-builder these days than used to be and think that\\'s a good thing But I\\'m running for Presidency of United States I\\'ve been in public service for 25 years because believe deeply in American goals and values and people of this country and that\\'s kind of want to be LEHRER Vice a rebuttal BUSH Well don\\'t question his passion question -- and don\\'t question his concern about war in Vietnam He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war Now that\\'s a certain passion that in my view it\\'s misguided passion He -- we have a big difference on issues You see last year in primary he expressed his passion He said \"\" am a strong liberal Democrat\"\" -- August \\'87 Then he said \"\" am a card-carrying member of ACLU \"\" That was what he said He is out there on out of mainstream He is very passionate My argument with governor is do we want this country to go that far left And wish we had time to let me explain But salute him for his passion We just have a big difference on where this country should be led and in what direction ought to go LEHRER Peter a question? Question for vice Peter JENNINGS I\\'d actually like to follow up if may on this mention you\\'ve made of his card carrying membership in American Civil Liberties Union You\\'ve used phrase \"\"card carrying\"\" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of ACLU that some people have come to believe that you\\'ve used to brand him in some way to identify him as people were identified in 1950s as less than patriotic I\\'d like to know why you keep repeating phrase and what\\'s important issue here? What is so wrong with governor being a member of an organization which has come to defense of among other people Colonel Oliver North? BUSH Nothing\\'s wrong with But just take a look at positions of ACLU But Peter please understand liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don\\'t like when say that he says he\\'s a card carrying member Now if that quote was wrong he can repudiate right here I\\'ve seen authoritatively written twice and if I\\'ve done him an injustice and he didn\\'t say I\\'m very very sorry But don\\'t agree with a lot of -- most of positions of ACLU simply don\\'t want to see ratings on movies don\\'t want my 10-year-old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie like those ratings systems don\\'t think they\\'re right to try to take tax exemption away from Catholic Church don\\'t want to see kiddie pornographic laws repealed; don\\'t want to see \"\"under God\"\" come out from our currency Now these are all positions of ACLU And don\\'t agree with them He has every right to exercise his passion as what he said a strong progressive liberal don\\'t agree with that come from a different point And think I\\'m more in touch with mainstream of America They raised same thing with me on Pledge of Allegiance You see I\\'d have found a way to sign that bill Governor Thompson of Illinois did I\\'m not questioning his patriotism He goes out and says man is questioning my patriotism And then all liberal columnists join in am not am questioning his judgment on these matters or where he\\'s coming from He has every right to do But believe that\\'s not what American people want and when he said when he said at convention ideology doesn\\'t matter just competence he was moving away from his own record from what his passion has been over years And that\\'s all I\\'m trying to do is put in focus And hope people don\\'t think that I\\'m questioning his patriotism when say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization LEHRER Governor a response DUKAKIS Well hope this is first and last time have to say this Of course vice is questioning my patriotism don\\'t think there\\'s any question about that and resent resent My parents came to this country as immigrants They taught me that this was greatest country in world I\\'m in public service because love this country believe in And nobody\\'s going to question my patriotism as vice has now repeatedly The fact of matter is if Pledge of Allegiance was acid test of one\\'s patriotism -- vice president\\'s been presiding officer in United States Senate for past seven and a half years To best of my knowledge he\\'s never once suggested that a session of Senate begin with Pledge of Allegiance Bush don\\'t question your patriotism When you\\'re attacked for your military record immediately said was inappropriate had no place in this campaign and rejected would hope that from this point on we get to issues that affect vast majority of Americans jobs schools health care housing environment Those are concerns of people that are watching us tonight Not labels that we attach to each other questions about each other\\'s patriotism and loyalty LEHRER The time is up Governor Let\\'s go now to John Mashek again A question for vice MASHEK Vice in a debate during Republican primaries you said most of nation\\'s homeless are suffering from mental illness an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals Estimates of homeless range from a low of 250 000 by government to around three million including working families and their children What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society? BUSH want to see McKinney Act fully funded believe that that would help in terms of shelter want to see -- when talked at our convention about a thousand points of light was talking about enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help The Governor\\'s wife has been ve\"')"

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"LEHRER On behalf of Commission on Presidential Debates am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of 1988 campaign I'm Jim Lehrer of MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour My colleagues on panel are John Mashek of Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News For next 90 minutes we will be questioning candidates for of United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of two candidates The candidates are Vice George Bush Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis Democratic nominee LEHRER Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters The first question by agreement between two candidates goes to Vice Bush It is a domestic question You have two minutes for an answer sir The polls say number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs? BUSH think we've seen a deterioration of values think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned For a while as recall even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs and think that's all wrong So we've seen a deterioration in values and one of things that think we should do about in terms of cause is to instill values into young people in our schools We got away we got into this feeling that value-free education was thing And don't believe that at all do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use And of course as far as how we make better yes we can do better on interdiction But we've got to do a lot better on education and we have to do be tougher on those who commcrimes We've got to get after users more We have to change this whole culture You know saw a movie Crocodile Dundee And saw cocaine scene treated with humor as though this was a humorous little incident And it's bad Everybody ought to be in this thing Entertainment industry people involved in schools education And isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem But we have got to instill values in these young people And have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what would do as of United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in neighborhoods But think we're all in this together and my plea to American people is values in schools LEHRER Governor you have one minute to respond DUKAKIS agree with Bush that values are important But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from top That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with consequences remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call Governor's Alliance Against Drugs and a young 16-year-old girl coming up to me desperate addicted dependent saying Governor need help We're providing that young woman with help But want to be a of United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator that we never again funnel aid to contras through convicted drug dealers Values begin at top in White House Those are values want to bring to presidency and to White House beginning in January of 1989 LEHRER Governor a follow-up question You have two minutes to answer Are you suggesting sir that Reagan is one of causes of drug problem in this country? DUKAKIS I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership Jim have a special responsibility not only to come up with programs and have outlined in detail very important very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention And Bush is right -- two go hand in hand But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking if we don't understand that that sends out a very very bad message to our young people it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that talked about and to young people like her all over country and say to them we want to help you Now I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad doubling number of drug enforcement agents having a hemispheric summsoon after 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together But we also have to take demand seriously You know we have 5 percent of world's population in this country We're consuming 50 percent of world's cocaine And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for country We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state and that's kind of effort we need in every elementary school in United States of America And we've got to begin early in first second and third grade before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very very dangerous substances guess question would ask of Bush is how we instill those values how we create this environment for drug free schools that we want in this country If he or representatives of administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes possible for us to cut off and to be an example to our kids all over country LEHRER A minute to rebut Vice BUSH Well other day my opponent was given a briefing by CIA asked for and received same briefing am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information And what I'm about to say is unclassified Seven administrations were dealing with Noriega It was Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice And as governor of Massachusetts knows there was no evidence that governor -- that Noriega was involved in drugs no hard evidence until we indicted him And so think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective Panama is a friendly country went down there and talked to of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering and Noriega was there but there was no evidence at that time and when evidence was there we indicted him And we want to bring him to justice And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations LEHRER All right next question will be asked by John Mashek It goes to Governor Dukakis and you'll have two minutes to answer MASHEK Governor Dukakis another troublesome issue for voters this year is bulging federal defic In a Dukakis administration you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficdown? DUKAKIS Yes I've been very specific about those John And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficdown because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices First I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford Bush has been critical of me for that but think those are kinds of tough choices you have to make I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on and I've outlined those in detail Secondly we've got to invest in economic growth in this country in every part of this country Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that defic Thirdly we have to bring interest rates down and we will as we come up with a good solid plan with Congress for bringing that deficdown And finally we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country It's very unfair to average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permthese monies to go uncollected I've also suggested that on domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20 to $25 billion a year which is what we've been doing under this administration We can help people to live better lives and at same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare and to become productive citizens again The thing don't understand about Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficdown given what he says he wants to do He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes although he's broken that pledge at least times in last year that know of; he wants to give wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs If he keeps this up he's going to be Joe Isuzu of American politics DUKAKIS But hope you won't take my five seconds away from me will say this -- LEHRER Your two minutes is up Governor DUKAKIS If he's serious about what he's saying then only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid Social Security Trust Fund and he tried that in 1985 and think he's going to try again LEHRER You have a minute to rebut BUSH Is this time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor Let me help Governor There are so many things there don't quite know where to begin When you cut capital gains you put people to work John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains Paul Tsongas a liberal senator from Massachusetts said dumbest thing did was to oppose capital gains cut It's not going to cost government money It's going to increase revenues to federal government and it's going to create jobs So that's one of things that think makes a big difference between us Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget but nevertheless governor raised taxes five different times That happens to be a fact And so let's kind of stay on issue and have made a specific proposal for what call a flexible freeze And permits -- economists on East Coast and West think it's good -- permits to sort out priorities and we continue to grow because will not raise taxes LEHRER Your time is up too A follow-up John MASHEK Vice you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at same time you've proposed this capital gains cut you've proposed more incentive breaks for oil industry You've suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in defic Is deficno longer really a concern of yours Republican Party or taxpayers? BUSH think it's Republican Party and my concern to bring down And presidential leadership that want to provide in this area will bring down but we've got to get Democrats -- Congress under control They do all spending they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime I'd like to ask Governor to join in getting for what 43 governors have line-item veto He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso would like a balanced budget amendment But dynamics of economy -- we cut taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years So problem is -- it's not that working is being taxed too little or person working out -- woman working in some factory being taxed too little It is that we are continuing to spend too much So my formula says grow at rate of inflation Perm to set priorities on where we do spending And remember federal defichas come down $70 billion in one year in 1987 And if we -- and -- actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling growth of spending Spending was only up something like 4 percent So isn't that we're taking too little -- from taxpayer -- we're spending too much still And formula I've given you works we've put through a good economic model we've got good economists on West Coast Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in -- Massachusetts And they agree that if we can do what I've said we can get down without going and socking American taxpayer once again Capital gains one more point on that please let's learn from history A capital gains differential will increase jobs increase risk taking increase revenues to federal government LEHRER Governor you have a minute to rebut DUKAKIS Well hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be of United States listen to Vice very carefully What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in federal debt in course of past eight years an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years is a tax cut for wealthiest 1 percent of people in this country an average of about $30 000 that we're going to give to people making $200 000 a year Why that's more than average teacher makes We've had enough of that ladies and gentlemen We've run up more debt in last eight years than under all Presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices can work with Congress can get that deficdown and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country LEHRER All right next question will be asked by Anne Groer and will go Vice You have two minutes to answer sir GROER Vice you've said you want a kinder gentler presidency one that helps less fortunate Today 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it? BUSH One thing will not do is sock every business in country and thus throw some people out of work want to keep this economic recovery going More Americans at work today than any time in history a greater percentage of work force What will do is permpeople to buy into Medicaid believe that's answer am proud to have been part of an administration that past first catastrophic health bill And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to very kind of people we're talking about here But we've got to keep going forward without killing off engine and throwing people out of work So answer lies seems to me in full enforcement of catastrophic program It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then also -- do not want to see us mandate across board that every company has to do this because really think that marginal operators are going to go say \"\"We can't make \"\" And think then you're going to see that people are put out of work All these programs -- and this cost on his -- is -- was -- saw an estimate I'd love to know what he thinks $35 -- $40 billion -- and seems to me that somebody pays that There isn't any such thing as something free out there It either gets passed along as increased prices or gets passed along by people being put out of work so business can continue to compete So think we ought to do in Medicaid system think we ought to do by full enforcement of catastrophic health insurance think we ought to do by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance But just don't want to mandate and risk putting this -- setting recovery back LEHRER A rebuttal Governor? DUKAKIS But George that's no answer BUSH You don't like answer but it's an answer DUKAKIS Well no it's no answer to those 37 million people most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay bills if their kids get sick at night was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens working citizens All of them with little or no health insurance One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance Has an 11-year-old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills My state just became only state in nation to provide for universal health care and we did with support of business community and labor and health care community and with virtually everybody in state The fact of matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying freight because they're paying for those who aren't And think it's time that when you got a job in this country came with health insurance That's way we're going to provide basic health security for all of citizens of this country of ours LEHRER Follow-up Anne? GROER Yes Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by Vice and you have defended in this way would like to move on to perhaps one of most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS In -- at end of September thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT which is only Federally approved drug for treatment of disease Now I'd like to now sir if -- what your position is on extending that and what is you think government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease DUKAKIS Well Anne let me just say before answer your question that didn't know that Vice attacked our program in Massachusetts hope he hasn't Because has won support of a great many people all over state and think it's a model for what hope we can do across country But when proposed my plan this past Tuesday he or one of his spokesmen called socialized medicine The last time Vice used that phrase suspect he remembers don't you? It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare Well he was wrong then and he's wrong now LEHRER If may interrupt at this point and caution audience as did before we went on air please hold down You're only taking time away from your candidate when you do that Governor continue please DUKAKIS Let me say this about AIDS It's single most important public health crisis single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through Congress which will commthis nation to resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for victims of AIDS think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and think FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January And would encourage current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly But we have not had kind of leadership we should have had In this particular area think Vice and are in general agreement on what we have to do The special federal commission made good solid recommendations think we're both supportive of them and would strongly lead in that area as have in my state as Governor LEHRER Vice a minute of rebuttal BUSH Well we're on right track The NIH is doing a good job in research The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging proper kind of education notice that Governor did not mention any testing But we got to have a knowledge base Testing should be confidential but we have to have a knowledge We can't simply stick our heads in sands in terms of testing I'm chairman of President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help And you got to be careful here because there's a safety factor but think these things -- and then also am one who believes we've got to go extra mile in clean -- being sure that that blood supply is pure We cannot have a lack of confidence in blood supply when comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature So research speeding drugs to market testing blood supply are very important elements of this LEHRER Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings It goes to Governor JENNINGS Vice Governor Governor one theme that keeps coming up about way you govern -- you've both mentioned leadership tonight so I'd like to stay with that for a second The theme that keeps coming up about way you govern is passionless technocratic -- DUKAKIS Passionless? JENNINGS Passionless technocratic smartest clerk in world Your critics maintain that in 1960s your public passion was not war in Vietnam or civil rights but no fault auto insurance And they say in 1970s you played virtually no role in painful busing crisis in Boston Given fact that a must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion We need to know if this is a fair portraof your governing or if is a stereotype And if isn't fair give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a needs? DUKAKIS Peter care deeply about people all people working people working families people all over this country who in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck in other cases are having a hard time opening up door of college opportunity to their children in other cases don't have basic health insurance which for most of us we accept as a matter of course and assume we're going to have in order to pay bills that we incur when we get sick I'm somebody who believes deeply in genuine opportunity for every single citizen in this country and that's kind of passion brought to my state was a leader in civil rights movement in my state and in my legislature cared very deeply about that war in Vietnam thought was a mistake thought was wrong And was one of few legislators early in that war that took a stand against war think was right stand at time and think history has proved us to be correct But have learned over time served one term was defeated as you know and defeat sometimes is an important lesson think I'm a much better Governor today think I'm a much better person a much better listener think I'll be a much better for having gone through that experience But things that we have done in my state to bring opportunity to people on public assistance -- over 50 000 families on welfare that we've helped to move from welfare to work and to become productive citizens The universal health care bill that we just talked about which will guarantee health care for all of our citizens opening up of opportunity to minorities in my state affirmative action minority contracting fact that we have a 3 percent unemployment rate and more jobs than people to fill them which gives us a tremendous opportunity to reach out to everybody and make them a part of this wonderful nation of ours with opportunity that we create These are things that believe in very very deeply may be a little calmer than some about may be a greater consensus-builder these days than used to be and think that's a good thing But I'm running for Presidency of United States I've been in public service for 25 years because believe deeply in American goals and values and people of this country and that's kind of want to be LEHRER Vice a rebuttal BUSH Well don't question his passion question -- and don't question his concern about war in Vietnam He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war Now that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion He -- we have a big difference on issues You see last year in primary he expressed his passion He said \"\" am a strong liberal Democrat\"\" -- August '87 Then he said \"\" am a card-carrying member of ACLU \"\" That was what he said He is out there on out of mainstream He is very passionate My argument with governor is do we want this country to go that far left And wish we had time to let me explain But salute him for his passion We just have a big difference on where this country should be led and in what direction ought to go LEHRER Peter a question? Question for vice Peter JENNINGS I'd actually like to follow up if may on this mention you've made of his card carrying membership in American Civil Liberties Union You've used phrase \"\"card carrying\"\" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of ACLU that some people have come to believe that you've used to brand him in some way to identify him as people were identified in 1950s as less than patriotic I'd like to know why you keep repeating phrase and what's important issue here? What is so wrong with governor being a member of an organization which has come to defense of among other people Colonel Oliver North? BUSH Nothing's wrong with But just take a look at positions of ACLU But Peter please understand liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like when say that he says he's a card carrying member Now if that quote was wrong he can repudiate right here I've seen authoritatively written twice and if I've done him an injustice and he didn't say I'm very very sorry But don't agree with a lot of -- most of positions of ACLU simply don't want to see ratings on movies don't want my 10-year-old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie like those ratings systems don't think they're right to try to take tax exemption away from Catholic Church don't want to see kiddie pornographic laws repealed; don't want to see \"\"under God\"\" come out from our currency Now these are all positions of ACLU And don't agree with them He has every right to exercise his passion as what he said a strong progressive liberal don't agree with that come from a different point And think I'm more in touch with mainstream of America They raised same thing with me on Pledge of Allegiance You see I'd have found a way to sign that bill Governor Thompson of Illinois did I'm not questioning his patriotism He goes out and says man is questioning my patriotism And then all liberal columnists join in am not am questioning his judgment on these matters or where he's coming from He has every right to do But believe that's not what American people want and when he said when he said at convention ideology doesn't matter just competence he was moving away from his own record from what his passion has been over years And that's all I'm trying to do is put in focus And hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization LEHRER Governor a response DUKAKIS Well hope this is first and last time have to say this Of course vice is questioning my patriotism don't think there's any question about that and resent resent My parents came to this country as immigrants They taught me that this was greatest country in world I'm in public service because love this country believe in And nobody's going to question my patriotism as vice has now repeatedly The fact of matter is if Pledge of Allegiance was acid test of one's patriotism -- vice president's been presiding officer in United States Senate for past seven and a half years To best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of Senate begin with Pledge of Allegiance Bush don't question your patriotism When you're attacked for your military record immediately said was inappropriate had no place in this campaign and rejected would hope that from this point on we get to issues that affect vast majority of Americans jobs schools health care housing environment Those are concerns of people that are watching us tonight Not labels that we attach to each other questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty LEHRER The time is up Governor Let's go now to John Mashek again A question for vice MASHEK Vice in a debate during Republican primaries you said most of nation's homeless are suffering from mental illness an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals Estimates of homeless range from a low of 250 000 by government to around three million including working families and their children What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society? BUSH want to see McKinney Act fully funded believe that that would help in terms of shelter want to see -- when talked at our convention about a thousand points of light was talking about enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help The Governor's wife has been ve\"      |29012 |[\"lehrer, on, behalf, of, commission, on, presidential, debates, am, pleased, to, welcome, you, to, this, first, presidential, debate, of, 1988, campaign, i'm, jim, lehrer, of, macneil/lehrer, news, hour, my, colleagues, on, panel, are, john, mashek, of, atlanta, journal-constitution;, ann, groer, of, orlando, sentinel;, and, peter, jennings, of, abc, news, for, next, 90, minutes, we, will, be, questioning, candidates, for, of, united, states, following, a, format, designed, and, agreed, to, by, representatives, of, two, candidates, the, candidates, are, vice, george, bush, republican, nominee;, governor, michael, dukakis, democratic, nominee, lehrer, our, questions, this, evening, will, be, about, equally, divided, between, foreign, and, domestic, policy, matters, the, first, question, by, agreement, between, two, candidates, goes, to, vice, bush, it, is, a, domestic, question, you, have, two, minutes, for, an, answer, sir, the, polls, say, number, one, domestic, issue, to, a, majority, of, voters, is, drugs, what, is, there, about, these, times, that, drives, or, draws, so, many, americans, to, use, drugs?, bush, think, we've, seen, a, deterioration, of, values, think, for, a, while, as, a, nation, we, condoned, those, things, we, should, have, condemned, for, a, while, as, recall, even, seems, to, me, that, there, was, talk, of, legalizing, or, decriminalizing, marijuana, and, other, drugs, and, think, that's, all, wrong, so, we've, seen, a, deterioration, in, values, and, one, of, things, that, think, we, should, do, about, in, terms, of, cause, is, to, instill, values, into, young, people, in, our, schools, we, got, away, we, got, into, this, feeling, that, value-free, education, was, thing, and, don't, believe, that, at, all, do, believe, there, are, fundamental, rights, and, wrongs, as, far, as, use, and, of, course, as, far, as, how, we, make, better, yes, we, can, do, better, on, interdiction, but, we've, got, to, do, a, lot, better, on, education, and, we, have, to, do, be, tougher, on, those, who, commcrimes, we've, got, to, get, after, users, more, we, have, to, change, this, whole, culture, you, know, saw, a, movie, crocodile, dundee, and, saw, cocaine, scene, treated, with, humor, as, though, this, was, a, humorous, little, incident, and, it's, bad, everybody, ought, to, be, in, this, thing, entertainment, industry, people, involved, in, schools, education, and, isn't, a, republican, or, a, democrat, or, a, liberal, problem, but, we, have, got, to, instill, values, in, these, young, people, and, have, put, forward, a, many-point, drug, program, that, includes, what, would, do, as, of, united, states;, in, terms, of, doing, better, on, interdiction;, and, in, terms, of, better, in, neighborhoods, but, think, we're, all, in, this, together, and, my, plea, to, american, people, is, values, in, schools, lehrer, governor, you, have, one, minute, to, respond, dukakis, agree, with, bush, that, values, are, important, but, it's, important, that, our, leaders, demonstrate, those, values, from, top, that, means, those, of, us, who, are, elected, to, positions, of, political, leadership, have, to, reflect, those, values, ourselves, here, we, are, with, a, government, that's, been, dealing, with, a, drug-running, panamanian, dictator, we've, been, dealing, with, him;, he's, been, dealing, drugs, to, our, kids, governors, like, me, and, others, have, been, trying, to, deal, with, consequences, remember, being, in, a, high, school, in, my, own, state, as, we, were, organizing, something, we, call, governor's, alliance, against, drugs, and, a, young, 16-year-old, girl, coming, up, to, me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, governor, need, help, we're, providing, that, young, woman, with, help, but, want, to, be, a, of, united, states, who, makes, sure, that, we, never, again, do, business, with, a, drug-running, panamanian, dictator, that, we, never, again, funnel, aid, to, contras, through, convicted, drug, dealers, values, begin, at, top, in, white, house, those, are, values, want, to, bring, to, presidency, and, to, white, house, beginning, in, january, of, 1989, lehrer, governor, a, follow-up, question, you, have, two, minutes, to, answer, are, you, suggesting, sir, that, reagan, is, one, of, causes, of, drug, problem, in, this, country?, dukakis, i'm, saying, that, those, of, us, who, are, elected, to, positions, of, political, leadership, jim, have, a, special, responsibility, not, only, to, come, up, with, programs, and, have, outlined, in, detail, very, important, very, strong, program, of, enforcement, as, well, as, drug, education, prevention, and, bush, is, right, --, two, go, hand, in, hand, but, if, our, government, itself, is, doing, business, with, people, who, we, know, are, engaged, in, drug, profiteering, and, drug, trafficking, if, we, don't, understand, that, that, sends, out, a, very, very, bad, message, to, our, young, people, it's, a, little, difficult, for, me, to, understand, just, how, we, can, reach, out, to, that, youngster, that, talked, about, and, to, young, people, like, her, all, over, country, and, say, to, them, we, want, to, help, you, now, i've, outlined, in, great, detail, a, program, for, being, tough, on, enforcement, at, home, and, abroad, doubling, number, of, drug, enforcement, agents, having, a, hemispheric, summsoon, after, 20th, of, january, when, we, bring, our, democratic, neighbors, and, allies, together, here, in, this, hemisphere, and, go, to, work, together, but, we, also, have, to, take, demand, seriously, you, know, we, have, 5, percent, of, world's, population, in, this, country, we're, consuming, 50, percent, of, world's, cocaine, and, in, my, state, i'm, proud, to, say, we've, organized, a, drug, education, and, prevention, program, which, federal, drug, enforcement, administration, says, is, a, model, for, country, we're, helping, youngsters;, we're, reaching, out, to, them, and, we're, beginning, with, drug, education, and, prevention, beginning, in, early, elementary, grades, in, every, elementary, school, in, our, state, and, that's, kind, of, effort, we, need, in, every, elementary, school, in, united, states, of, america, and, we've, got, to, begin, early, in, first, second, and, third, grade, before, our, youngsters, begin, to, experiment, with, these, very, very, dangerous, substances, guess, question, would, ask, of, bush, is, how, we, instill, those, values, how, we, create, this, environment, for, drug, free, schools, that, we, want, in, this, country, if, he, or, representatives, of, administration, are, either, with, or, involving, people, like, noriega, in, our, foreign, policy, or, don't, pursue, that, connection, in, a, way, that, makes, possible, for, us, to, cut, off, and, to, be, an, example, to, our, kids, all, over, country, lehrer, a, minute, to, rebut, vice, bush, well, other, day, my, opponent, was, given, a, briefing, by, cia, asked, for, and, received, same, briefing, am, very, careful, in, public, life, about, dealing, with, classified, information, and, what, i'm, about, to, say, is, unclassified, seven, administrations, were, dealing, with, noriega, it, was, reagan-bush, administration, that, brought, this, man, to, justice, and, as, governor, of, massachusetts, knows, there, was, no, evidence, that, governor, --, that, noriega, was, involved, in, drugs, no, hard, evidence, until, we, indicted, him, and, so, think, it's, about, time, we, get, this, noriega, matter, in, perspective, panama, is, a, friendly, country, went, down, there, and, talked, to, of, panama, about, cleaning, up, their, money, laundering, and, noriega, was, there, but, there, was, no, evidence, at, that, time, and, when, evidence, was, there, we, indicted, him, and, we, want, to, bring, him, to, justice, and, so, call, off, all, those, pickets, out, there, that, are, trying, to, tear, down, seven, different, administrations, lehrer, all, right, next, question, will, be, asked, by, john, mashek, it, goes, to, governor, dukakis, and, you'll, have, two, minutes, to, answer, mashek, governor, dukakis, another, troublesome, issue, for, voters, this, year, is, bulging, federal, defic, in, a, dukakis, administration, you, say, taxes, will, be, raised, only, as, a, last, resort, would, you, identify, for, us, then, please, three, specific, programs, that, you, are, willing, to, cut, to, bring, that, deficdown?, dukakis, yes, i've, been, very, specific, about, those, john, and, let, me, lay, out, for, you, my, own, strategy, for, bring, that, deficdown, because, as, a, chief, executive, that's, balanced, ten, budgets, in, a, row, i've, had, to, make, those, tough, decisions, and, those, tough, choices, first, i've, suggested, that, there, are, certain, weapons, systems, which, we, don't, need, and, we, can't, afford, bush, has, been, critical, of, me, for, that, but, think, those, are, kinds, of, tough, choices, you, have, to, make, i've, also, suggested, that, there, are, weapons, systems, that, we, should, proceed, on, and, i've, outlined, those, in, detail, secondly, we've, got, to, invest, in, economic, growth, in, this, country, in, every, part, of, this, country, building, that, kind, of, growth, expands, revenues, and, helps, to, bring, down, that, defic, thirdly, we, have, to, bring, interest, rates, down, and, we, will, as, we, come, up, with, a, good, solid, plan, with, congress, for, bringing, that, deficdown, and, finally, we've, got, to, go, out, there, and, collect, billions, and, billions, of, dollars, in, taxes, owed, that, aren't, being, paid, to, this, country, it's, very, unfair, to, average, taxpayer, who, pays, his, taxes, and, pays, them, on, time, to, permthese, monies, to, go, uncollected, i've, also, suggested, that, on, domestic, side, there, are, areas, where, we, can, make, some, cuts, we, ought, to, be, able, to, come, up, with, an, agricultural, policy, in, this, country, that, gives, our, farm, families, a, fair, price, and, a, decent, future, without, spending, $20, to, $25, billion, a, year, which, is, what, we've, been, doing, under, this, administration, we, can, help, people, to, live, better, lives, and, at, same, time, save, money, by, helping, hundreds, of, thousands, of, families, on, welfare, to, get, off, or, welfare, and, to, become, productive, citizens, again, the, thing, don't, understand, about, bush's, approach, to, this, is, how, he, could, possibly, be, serious, about, bringing, that, deficdown, given, what, he, says, he, wants, to, do, he, seems, to, want, to, spend, a, great, deal, of, money, on, just, about, every, weapon, system;, he, says, he's, against, new, taxes, although, he's, broken, that, pledge, at, least, times, in, last, year, that, know, of;, he, wants, to, give, wealthiest, taxpayers, in, this, country, a, five-year, $40, billion, tax, break, he, also, wants, to, spend, a, lot, of, money, on, additional, programs, if, he, keeps, this, up, he's, going, to, be, joe, isuzu, of, american, politics, dukakis, but, hope, you, won't, take, my, five, seconds, away, from, me, will, say, this, --, lehrer, your, two, minutes, is, up, governor, dukakis, if, he's, serious, about, what, he's, saying, then, only, place, he, can, go, to, balance, that, budget, is, to, raid, social, security, trust, fund, and, he, tried, that, in, 1985, and, think, he's, going, to, try, again, lehrer, you, have, a, minute, to, rebut, bush, is, this, time, to, unleash, our, one-liners?, that, answer, was, about, as, clear, as, boston, harbor, let, me, help, governor, there, are, so, many, things, there, don't, quite, know, where, to, begin, when, you, cut, capital, gains, you, put, people, to, work, john, kennedy, proposed, cutting, capital, gains, paul, tsongas, a, liberal, senator, from, massachusetts, said, dumbest, thing, did, was, to, oppose, capital, gains, cut, it's, not, going, to, cost, government, money, it's, going, to, increase, revenues, to, federal, government, and, it's, going, to, create, jobs, so, that's, one, of, things, that, think, makes, a, big, difference, between, us, massachusetts, doesn't, have, an, enormous, defense, budget, but, nevertheless, governor, raised, taxes, five, different, times, that, happens, to, be, a, fact, and, so, let's, kind, of, stay, on, issue, and, have, made, a, specific, proposal, for, what, call, a, flexible, freeze, and, permits, --, economists, on, east, coast, and, west, think, it's, good, --, permits, to, sort, out, priorities, and, we, continue, to, grow, because, will, not, raise, taxes, lehrer, your, time, is, up, too, a, follow-up, john, mashek, vice, you, have, vowed, not, to, raise, taxes, of, any, kind, during, your, administration, and, at, same, time, you've, proposed, this, capital, gains, cut, you've, proposed, more, incentive, breaks, for, oil, industry, you've, suggested, new, spending, programs, and, even, some, republicans, say, flexible, freeze, you, just, spoke, about, will, hardly, make, a, dent, in, defic, is, deficno, longer, really, a, concern, of, yours, republican, party, or, taxpayers?, bush, think, it's, republican, party, and, my, concern, to, bring, down, and, presidential, leadership, that, want, to, provide, in, this, area, will, bring, down, but, we've, got, to, get, democrats, --, congress, under, control, they, do, all, spending, they, appropriate, every, dime, and, tell, us, how, to, spend, every, dime, i'd, like, to, ask, governor, to, join, in, getting, for, what, 43, governors, have, line-item, veto, he, has, to, operate, in, massachusetts, under, a, balanced, budget, proviso, would, like, a, balanced, budget, amendment, but, dynamics, of, economy, --, we, cut, taxes, and, revenues, are, up, by, 25, percent, in, three, years, so, problem, is, --, it's, not, that, working, is, being, taxed, too, little, or, person, working, out, --, woman, working, in, some, factory, being, taxed, too, little, it, is, that, we, are, continuing, to, spend, too, much, so, my, formula, says, grow, at, rate, of, inflation, perm, to, set, priorities, on, where, we, do, spending, and, remember, federal, defichas, come, down, $70, billion, in, one, year, in, 1987, and, if, we, --, and, --, actually, this, year, congress, is, doing, a, little, better, in, controlling, growth, of, spending, spending, was, only, up, something, like, 4, percent, so, isn't, that, we're, taking, too, little, --, from, taxpayer, --, we're, spending, too, much, still, and, formula, i've, given, you, works, we've, put, through, a, good, economic, model, we've, got, good, economists, on, west, coast, michael, boskin, and, marty, feldstein, up, there, who's, a, very, respected, economist, in, --, massachusetts, and, they, agree, that, if, we, can, do, what, i've, said, we, can, get, down, without, going, and, socking, american, taxpayer, once, again, capital, gains, one, more, point, on, that, please, let's, learn, from, history, a, capital, gains, differential, will, increase, jobs, increase, risk, taking, increase, revenues, to, federal, government, lehrer, governor, you, have, a, minute, to, rebut, dukakis, well, hope, all, of, those, americans, out, there, who, are, watching, us, listening, to, us, and, trying, to, make, up, their, mind, about, which, one, of, us, ought, to, be, of, united, states, listen, to, vice, very, carefully, what, he's, proposing, after, over, a, trillion, in, new, debt, which, has, been, added, in, federal, debt, in, course, of, past, eight, years, an, iou, our, children, and, grandchildren, will, be, paying, for, years, is, a, tax, cut, for, wealthiest, 1, percent, of, people, in, this, country, an, average, of, about, $30, 000, that, we're, going, to, give, to, people, making, $200, 000, a, year, why, that's, more, than, average, teacher, makes, we've, had, enough, of, that, ladies, and, gentlemen, we've, run, up, more, debt, in, last, eight, years, than, under, all, presidents, from, george, washington, to, jimmy, carter, combined, it's, time, for, a, chief, executive, who, can, make, tough, choices, can, work, with, congress, can, get, that, deficdown, and, begin, to, build, a, strong, fiscal, foundation, under, this, country, lehrer, all, right, next, question, will, be, asked, by, anne, groer, and, will, go, vice, you, have, two, minutes, to, answer, sir, groer, vice, you've, said, you, want, a, kinder, gentler, presidency, one, that, helps, less, fortunate, today, 37, million, americans, including, many, working, families, with, aging, parents, and, young, children, cannot, afford, any, health, insurance, but, earn, too, much, to, qualify, for, medicaid, what, will, you, do, to, provide, protection, for, them, and, how, will, you, pay, for, it?, bush, one, thing, will, not, do, is, sock, every, business, in, country, and, thus, throw, some, people, out, of, work, want, to, keep, this, economic, recovery, going, more, americans, at, work, today, than, any, time, in, history, a, greater, percentage, of, work, force, what, will, do, is, permpeople, to, buy, into, medicaid, believe, that's, answer, am, proud, to, have, been, part, of, an, administration, that, past, first, catastrophic, health, bill, and, in, that, there, are, some, medicaid, provisions, that, will, be, very, helpful, to, very, kind, of, people, we're, talking, about, here, but, we've, got, to, keep, going, forward, without, killing, off, engine, and, throwing, people, out, of, work, so, answer, lies, seems, to, me, in, full, enforcement, of, catastrophic, program, it, lies, to, me, in, flexibility, in, medicaid, so, people, at, lowest, end, can, buy, in, there, and, get, their, needs, covered, and, then, also, --, do, not, want, to, see, us, mandate, across, board, that, every, company, has, to, do, this, because, really, think, that, marginal, operators, are, going, to, go, say, \"\"we, can't, make, \"\", and, think, then, you're, going, to, see, that, people, are, put, out, of, work, all, these, programs, --, and, this, cost, on, his, --, is, --, was, --, saw, an, estimate, i'd, love, to, know, what, he, thinks, $35, --, $40, billion, --, and, seems, to, me, that, somebody, pays, that, there, isn't, any, such, thing, as, something, free, out, there, it, either, gets, passed, along, as, increased, prices, or, gets, passed, along, by, people, being, put, out, of, work, so, business, can, continue, to, compete, so, think, we, ought, to, do, in, medicaid, system, think, we, ought, to, do, by, full, enforcement, of, catastrophic, health, insurance, think, we, ought, to, do, by, everybody, doing, what, they, can, do, out, of, conscience, it's, a, terrible, problems, in, terms, of, flexibility, on, private, insurance, but, just, don't, want, to, mandate, and, risk, putting, this, --, setting, recovery, back, lehrer, a, rebuttal, governor?, dukakis, but, george, that's, no, answer, bush, you, don't, like, answer, but, it's, an, answer, dukakis, well, no, it's, no, answer, to, those, 37, million, people, most, of, them, members, of, working, families, who, don't, have, a, dime, of, health, insurance, and, don't, know, how, to, pay, bills, if, their, kids, get, sick, at, night, was, in, houston, on, tuesday, meeting, with, a, group, of, good, citizens, working, citizens, all, of, them, with, little, or, no, health, insurance, one, of, them, was, a, father, who, had, been, laid, off, a, few, months, ago, and, lost, his, health, insurance, has, an, 11-year-old, son, and, can't, let, that, son, compete, in, sports, and, little, league, because, he's, afraid, he's, going, to, get, hurt, and, he, won't, be, able, to, provide, health, insurance, to, pay, those, bills, my, state, just, became, only, state, in, nation, to, provide, for, universal, health, care, and, we, did, with, support, of, business, community, and, labor, and, health, care, community, and, with, virtually, everybody, in, state, the, fact, of, matter, is, that, employers, who, today, are, insuring, their, employees, are, paying, freight, because, they're, paying, for, those, who, aren't, and, think, it's, time, that, when, you, got, a, job, in, this, country, came, with, health, insurance, that's, way, we're, going, to, provide, basic, health, security, for, all, of, citizens, of, this, country, of, ours, lehrer, follow-up, anne?, groer, yes, since, your, massachusetts, health, plan, has, been, attacked, by, vice, and, you, have, defended, in, this, way, would, like, to, move, on, to, perhaps, one, of, most, costly, medical, catastrophes, facing, americans, today, and, that, is, aids, in, --, at, end, of, september, thousands, of, aids, patients, will, lose, their, access, to, azt, which, is, only, federally, approved, drug, for, treatment, of, disease, now, i'd, like, to, now, sir, if, --, what, your, position, is, on, extending, that, and, what, is, you, think, government, ought, to, be, doing, about, making, azt, and, other, drugs, available, to, people, who, are, suffering, from, this, disease, dukakis, well, anne, let, me, just, say, before, answer, your, question, that, didn't, know, that, vice, attacked, our, program, in, massachusetts, hope, he, hasn't, because, has, won, support, of, a, great, many, people, all, over, state, and, think, it's, a, model, for, what, hope, we, can, do, across, country, but, when, proposed, my, plan, this, past, tuesday, he, or, one, of, his, spokesmen, called, socialized, medicine, the, last, time, vice, used, that, phrase, suspect, he, remembers, don't, you?, it, was, in, 1964, and, that's, what, he, called, medicare, well, he, was, wrong, then, and, he's, wrong, now, lehrer, if, may, interrupt, at, this, point, and, caution, audience, as, did, before, we, went, on, air, please, hold, down, you're, only, taking, time, away, from, your, candidate, when, you, do, that, governor, continue, please, dukakis, let, me, say, this, about, aids, it's, single, most, important, public, health, crisis, single, most, important, public, health, emergency, we've, had, in, our, lifetimes, and, think, there, are, a, number, of, things, we, have, to, do, including, supporting, legislation, which, is, now, moving, through, congress, which, will, commthis, nation, to, resources, to, find, a, cure, which, will, provide, broad, education, and, prevention, which, will, provide, sensitive, and, caring, treatment, for, victims, of, aids, think, we, have, to, demonstrate, some, flexibility, and, think, fda, is, attempting, to, do, so, now, in, trying, to, make, possible, for, new, and, experimental, drugs, to, be, available, to, people, who, are, at, risk, at, aids, and, would, hope, that, we, could, bring, that, kind, of, a, policy, to, bear, beginning, in, january, and, would, encourage, current, administration, to, proceed, with, that, kind, of, flexibility, where, it's, appropriate, and, where, it's, done, carefully, and, responsibly, but, we, have, not, had, kind, of, leadership, we, should, have, had, in, this, particular, area, think, vice, and, are, in, general, agreement, on, what, we, have, to, do, the, special, federal, commission, made, good, solid, recommendations, think, we're, both, supportive, of, them, and, would, strongly, lead, in, that, area, as, have, in, my, state, as, governor, lehrer, vice, a, minute, of, rebuttal, bush, well, we're, on, right, track, the, nih, is, doing, a, good, job, in, research, the, surgeon, general, is, doing, a, good, job, in, encouraging, proper, kind, of, education, notice, that, governor, did, not, mention, any, testing, but, we, got, to, have, a, knowledge, base, testing, should, be, confidential, but, we, have, to, have, a, knowledge, we, can't, simply, stick, our, heads, in, sands, in, terms, of, testing, i'm, chairman, of, president's, task, force, on, regulatory, relief, and, we, are, working, with, fda, and, they, have, sped, up, bringing, drugs, to, market, that, can, help, and, you, got, to, be, careful, here, because, there's, a, safety, factor, but, think, these, things, --, and, then, also, am, one, who, believes, we've, got, to, go, extra, mile, in, clean, --, being, sure, that, that, blood, supply, is, pure, we, cannot, have, a, lack, of, confidence, in, blood, supply, when, comes, to, operations, and, surgery, and, things, of, this, nature, so, research, speeding, drugs, to, market, testing, blood, supply, are, very, important, elements, of, this, lehrer, next, question, will, be, asked, by, peter, jennings, it, goes, to, governor, jennings, vice, governor, governor, one, theme, that, keeps, coming, up, about, way, you, govern, --, you've, both, mentioned, leadership, tonight, so, i'd, like, to, stay, with, that, for, a, second, the, theme, that, keeps, coming, up, about, way, you, govern, is, passionless, technocratic, --, dukakis, passionless?, jennings, passionless, technocratic, smartest, clerk, in, world, your, critics, maintain, that, in, 1960s, your, public, passion, was, not, war, in, vietnam, or, civil, rights, but, no, fault, auto, insurance, and, they, say, in, 1970s, you, played, virtually, no, role, in, painful, busing, crisis, in, boston, given, fact, that, a, must, sometimes, lead, by, sheer, inspiration, and, passion, we, need, to, know, if, this, is, a, fair, portraof, your, governing, or, if, is, a, stereotype, and, if, isn't, fair, give, us, an, example, of, where, you, have, had, that, passion, and, leadership, that, sometimes, a, needs?, dukakis, peter, care, deeply, about, people, all, people, working, people, working, families, people, all, over, this, country, who, in, some, cases, are, living, from, paycheck, to, paycheck, in, other, cases, are, having, a, hard, time, opening, up, door, of, college, opportunity, to, their, children, in, other, cases, don't, have, basic, health, insurance, which, for, most, of, us, we, accept, as, a, matter, of, course, and, assume, we're, going, to, have, in, order, to, pay, bills, that, we, incur, when, we, get, sick, i'm, somebody, who, believes, deeply, in, genuine, opportunity, for, every, single, citizen, in, this, country, and, that's, kind, of, passion, brought, to, my, state, was, a, leader, in, civil, rights, movement, in, my, state, and, in, my, legislature, cared, very, deeply, about, that, war, in, vietnam, thought, was, a, mistake, thought, was, wrong, and, was, one, of, few, legislators, early, in, that, war, that, took, a, stand, against, war, think, was, right, stand, at, time, and, think, history, has, proved, us, to, be, correct, but, have, learned, over, time, served, one, term, was, defeated, as, you, know, and, defeat, sometimes, is, an, important, lesson, think, i'm, a, much, better, governor, today, think, i'm, a, much, better, person, a, much, better, listener, think, i'll, be, a, much, better, for, having, gone, through, that, experience, but, things, that, we, have, done, in, my, state, to, bring, opportunity, to, people, on, public, assistance, --, over, 50, 000, families, on, welfare, that, we've, helped, to, move, from, welfare, to, work, and, to, become, productive, citizens, the, universal, health, care, bill, that, we, just, talked, about, which, will, guarantee, health, care, for, all, of, our, citizens, opening, up, of, opportunity, to, minorities, in, my, state, affirmative, action, minority, contracting, fact, that, we, have, a, 3, percent, unemployment, rate, and, more, jobs, than, people, to, fill, them, which, gives, us, a, tremendous, opportunity, to, reach, out, to, everybody, and, make, them, a, part, of, this, wonderful, nation, of, ours, with, opportunity, that, we, create, these, are, things, that, believe, in, very, very, deeply, may, be, a, little, calmer, than, some, about, may, be, a, greater, consensus-builder, these, days, than, used, to, be, and, think, that's, a, good, thing, but, i'm, running, for, presidency, of, united, states, i've, been, in, public, service, for, 25, years, because, believe, deeply, in, american, goals, and, values, and, people, of, this, country, and, that's, kind, of, want, to, be, lehrer, vice, a, rebuttal, bush, well, don't, question, his, passion, question, --, and, don't, question, his, concern, about, war, in, vietnam, he, introduced, or, supported, legislation, back, then, that, suggested, that, kids, of, massachusetts, should, be, exempt, from, going, overseas, in, that, war, now, that's, a, certain, passion, that, in, my, view, it's, misguided, passion, he, --, we, have, a, big, difference, on, issues, you, see, last, year, in, primary, he, expressed, his, passion, he, said, \"\", am, a, strong, liberal, democrat\"\", --, august, '87, then, he, said, \"\", am, a, card-carrying, member, of, aclu, \"\", that, was, what, he, said, he, is, out, there, on, out, of, mainstream, he, is, very, passionate, my, argument, with, governor, is, do, we, want, this, country, to, go, that, far, left, and, wish, we, had, time, to, let, me, explain, but, salute, him, for, his, passion, we, just, have, a, big, difference, on, where, this, country, should, be, led, and, in, what, direction, ought, to, go, lehrer, peter, a, question?, question, for, vice, peter, jennings, i'd, actually, like, to, follow, up, if, may, on, this, mention, you've, made, of, his, card, carrying, membership, in, american, civil, liberties, union, you've, used, phrase, \"\"card, carrying\"\", so, many, times, since, governor, dukakis, first, acknowledged, that, he, was, a, card, carrying, member, of, aclu, that, some, people, have, come, to, believe, that, you've, used, to, brand, him, in, some, way, to, identify, him, as, people, were, identified, in, 1950s, as, less, than, patriotic, i'd, like, to, know, why, you, keep, repeating, phrase, and, what's, important, issue, here?, what, is, so, wrong, with, governor, being, a, member, of, an, organization, which, has, come, to, defense, of, among, other, people, colonel, oliver, north?, bush, nothing's, wrong, with, but, just, take, a, look, at, positions, of, aclu, but, peter, please, understand, liberals, do, not, like, me, talking, about, liberal, they, don't, like, when, say, that, he, says, he's, a, card, carrying, member, now, if, that, quote, was, wrong, he, can, repudiate, right, here, i've, seen, authoritatively, written, twice, and, if, i've, done, him, an, injustice, and, he, didn't, say, i'm, very, very, sorry, but, don't, agree, with, a, lot, of, --, most, of, positions, of, aclu, simply, don't, want, to, see, ratings, on, movies, don't, want, my, 10-year-old, grandchild, to, go, into, an, x-rated, movie, like, those, ratings, systems, don't, think, they're, right, to, try, to, take, tax, exemption, away, from, catholic, church, don't, want, to, see, kiddie, pornographic, laws, repealed;, don't, want, to, see, \"\"under, god\"\", come, out, from, our, currency, now, these, are, all, positions, of, aclu, and, don't, agree, with, them, he, has, every, right, to, exercise, his, passion, as, what, he, said, a, strong, progressive, liberal, don't, agree, with, that, come, from, a, different, point, and, think, i'm, more, in, touch, with, mainstream, of, america, they, raised, same, thing, with, me, on, pledge, of, allegiance, you, see, i'd, have, found, a, way, to, sign, that, bill, governor, thompson, of, illinois, did, i'm, not, questioning, his, patriotism, he, goes, out, and, says, man, is, questioning, my, patriotism, and, then, all, liberal, columnists, join, in, am, not, am, questioning, his, judgment, on, these, matters, or, where, he's, coming, from, he, has, every, right, to, do, but, believe, that's, not, what, american, people, want, and, when, he, said, when, he, said, at, convention, ideology, doesn't, matter, just, competence, he, was, moving, away, from, his, own, record, from, what, his, passion, has, been, over, years, and, that's, all, i'm, trying, to, do, is, put, in, focus, and, hope, people, don't, think, that, i'm, questioning, his, patriotism, when, say, he, used, his, words, to, describe, his, participation, in, that, organization, lehrer, governor, a, response, dukakis, well, hope, this, is, first, and, last, time, have, to, say, this, of, course, vice, is, questioning, my, patriotism, don't, think, there's, any, question, about, that, and, resent, resent, my, parents, came, to, this, country, as, immigrants, they, taught, me, that, this, was, greatest, country, in, world, i'm, in, public, service, because, love, this, country, believe, in, and, nobody's, going, to, question, my, patriotism, as, vice, has, now, repeatedly, the, fact, of, matter, is, if, pledge, of, allegiance, was, acid, test, of, one's, patriotism, --, vice, president's, been, presiding, officer, in, united, states, senate, for, past, seven, and, a, half, years, to, best, of, my, knowledge, he's, never, once, suggested, that, a, session, of, senate, begin, with, pledge, of, allegiance, bush, don't, question, your, patriotism, when, you're, attacked, for, your, military, record, immediately, said, was, inappropriate, had, no, place, in, this, campaign, and, rejected, would, hope, that, from, this, point, on, we, get, to, issues, that, affect, vast, majority, of, americans, jobs, schools, health, care, housing, environment, those, are, concerns, of, people, that, are, watching, us, tonight, not, labels, that, we, attach, to, each, other, questions, about, each, other's, patriotism, and, loyalty, lehrer, the, time, is, up, governor, let's, go, now, to, john, mashek, again, a, question, for, vice, mashek, vice, in, a, debate, during, republican, primaries, you, said,

Are we enthralled with material things less appreciative of nobility of work and sacrifice? My friends we are not sum of our possessions They are not measure of our lives In our hearts we know what matters We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car a bigger bank account We must hope to give them a sense of what means to be a loyal friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home his neighborhood and town better than he found And what do we want men and women who work with us to say when we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship? No no government can teach us to remember what is best in what we are But if man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate quieter deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things then he must America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle We as a people have such a purpose today It is to make kinder face of Nation and gentler face of world My friends we have work to do There are homeless lost and roaming There are children who have nothing no love and no normalcy There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction -- drugs welfare demoralization that rules slums There is crime to be conquered rough crime of streets There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love They need our care our guidance and our education though we bless them for choosing life The old solution old way was to think that public money alone could end these problems But we have learned that that is not so And in any case our funds are low We have a deficto bring down We have more will than wallet but will is what we need We will make hard choices looking at what we have and perhaps allocating differently making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety And then we will do wisest thing of all We will turn to only resource we have that in times of need always grows goodness and courage of American people And am speaking of a new engagement in lives of others a new activism hands-on and involved that gets job done We must bring in generations harnessing unused talent of elderly and unfocused energy of young For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is stewardship And generation born after Second World War has come of age have spoken of a Thousand Points of Light of all community organizations that are spread like stars throughout Nation doing good We will work hand in hand encouraging sometimes leading sometimes being led rewarding We will work on this in White House in Cabinet agencies will go to people and programs that are brighter points of light and I'll ask every member of my government to become involved The old ideas are new again because they're not old they are timeless duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in We need a new engagement too between Executive and Congress The challenges before us will be thrashed out with House and Senate And we must bring Federal budget into balance And we must ensure that America stands before world united strong at peace and fiscally sound But of course things may be difficult We need to compromise; we've had dissension We need harmony; we've had a chorus of discordant voices For Congress too has changed in our time There has grown a certain divisiveness We have seen hard looks and heard statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged but each other's motives And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other It's been this way since Vietnam That war cleaves us still But friends that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago and surely statute of limitation has been reached This is a fact The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory A new breeze is blowing and old bipartisanship must be made new again To my friends and yes do mean friends -- in loyal opposition and yes mean loyal -- put out my hand am putting out my hand to you am putting out my hand to you Majority Leader For this is thing This is age of offered hand And we can't turn back clocks and don't want to But when our fathers were young our differences ended at water's edge And we don't wish to turn back time but when our mothers were young Majority Leader Congress and Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live Let us negotiate soon and hard But in end let us produce The American people awaaction They didn't send us here to bicker They ask us to rise above merely partisan \"\"In crucial things unity\"\" -- and this my friends is crucial To world too we offer new engagement and a renewed vow We will stay strong to protect peace The offered hand is a reluctant fist; once made -- strong and can be used with great effect There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for Assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered Good will begets good will Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on Great nations like great men must keep their word When America says something America means whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps We will always try to speak clearly for candor is a compliment; but subtlety too is good and has its place While keeping our alliances and friendships around world strong ever strong we will continue new closeness with Soviet Union consistent both with our security and with progress One might say that our new relationship in part reflects triumph of hope and strength over experience But hope is good and so is strength and vigilance Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled But my thoughts have been turning past few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when flag goes by and woman who will tell her sons words of battle hymns don't mean this to be sentimental mean that on days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum inescapably connected by ties that bind Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land And to them say for watching democracy's big day For democracy belongs to us all and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with breeze And to all say No matter what your circumstances or where you are you are part of this day you are part of life of our great nation A is neither prince nor pope and don't seek a window on men's souls In fact yearn for a greater tolerance and easygoingness about each other's attitudes and way of life There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance The most obvious now is drugs And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship may as well have been a deadly bacteria so much has hurt body soul of our country And there is much to be done and to be said but take my word for This scourge will stop! And so there is much to do And tomorrow work begins And do not mistrust future do not fear what is ahead For our problems are large but our heart is larger Our challenges are great but our will is greater And if our flaws are endless God's love is truly boundless Some see leadership as high drama and sound of trumpets calling and sometimes is that But see history as a book with many pages and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning The new breeze blows a page turns story unfolds And so today a chapter begins a small and stately story of unity diversity and generosity

woman, who, will, tell, her, sons, words, of, battle, hymns, don't, mean, this, to, be, sentimental, mean, that, on, days, like, this, we, remember, that, we, are, all, part, of, a, continuum, inescapably, connected, by, ties, that, bind, our, children, are, watching, in, schools, throughout, our, great, land, and, to, them, say, for, watching, democracy's, big, day, for, democracy,

We build The stakes are high this year and choice is crucial for differences between two candidates are as deep and wide as they have ever been in our long history Not only two very different men but two very different ideas of future will be voted on this election day What all comes down to is this My opponent's view of world sees a long slow decline for our country an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal historical forces But America is not a decline America is a rising nation He sees America as another pleasant country on UN roll call somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe see America as leader - a unique nation with a special role in world This has been called American Century because in we were dominant force for good in world We saved Europe cured polio we went to moon and l world with our culture Now we are on verge of a new century and what country's name will bear? say will be another American century Our work is not done - our force is not spent There are those who say there isn't much of a difference this year But America don't let 'em fool ya Two parties this year ask for your support Both will speak of growth and peace But only one has proved can deliver Two parties this year ask for your trust but only one has earned Eight years ago stood here with Ronald Reagan and we promised together to break with past and return America to her greatness Eight years later look at what American people have produced highest level of economic growth in our entire history - and lowest level of world tensions in more than fifty years Some say this isn't an election about ideology it's an election about competence Well it's nice of them to want to play on our field But this election isn't only about competence for competence is a narrow ideal Competence makes trains run on time but doesn't know where they're going Competence is creed of technocrat who makes sure gears mesh but doesn't for a second understand magic of machine The truth is this election is about beliefs we share values we honor principles we hold dear But since someone brought up competence Consider size of our triumph A record high percentage of Americans with jobs a record high rate of new businesses - a record high rate of real personal income These are facts And one way you know our opponents know facts is that to attack record they have to misrepresent They call a Swiss cheese economy Well that's way may look to three blind mice But when they were in charge was all holes and no cheese Inflation was 12 percent when we came in We got down to four Interest rates were more than 21 We cut them in half Unemployment was up and climbing now it's lowest in 14 years My friends eight years ago this economy was flat on its back - intensive care We came in and gave emergency treatment Got temperature down by lowering regulation got blood pressure down when we lowered taxes Pretty soon patient was up back on his feet and stronger than ever And now who do we hear knocking on door but doctors who made him sick And they're telling us to put them in charge of case again My friends they're lucky we don't hthem with a malpractice suit!We've created 17 million new jobs in past five years - more than twice as many as Europe and Japan combined And they're good jobs The majority of them created in past six years paid an average of more than $22 000 a year Someone better take a message to Michael Tell him we've been creating good jobs at good wages The fact is they talk - we deliver They promise - we perform There are millions of young Americans in their 20's who barely remember days of gas lines and unemployment lines Now they're marrying and starting careers To those young people say \"\"You have opportunity you deserve - and I'm not going to let them take away from you \"\"There are millions of older Americans who were brutalized by inflation We arrested - and we're not going to let out on furlough We're going to keep Social Security trust fund sound and out of reach of big spenders To America's elderly say \"\"Once again you have security that is your right - and I'm not going to let them take away from you \"\" know liberal democrats are worried about economy They're worried it's going to remain strong And they're right is With right leadership But let's be frank Things aren't perfect in this country There are people who haven't tasted fruits of expansion I've talked to farmers about bills they can't pay I've been to factories that feel strain of change I've seen urban children who play amidst shattered glass and shattered lives And there are homeless And you know doesn't do any good to debate endlessly which policy mistake of '70's is responsible They're there We have to help them But what we must remember if we are to be responsible - and compassionate - is that economic growth is key to our endeavors want growth that stays that broadens and that touches finally all Americans form hollows of Kentucky to sunlstreets of Denver from suburbs of Chicago to broad avenues of New York from oil fields of Oklahoma to farms of great plains Can we do it? Of course we can We know how We've done If we continue to grow at our current rate we will be able to produce 30 million jobs in next eight years We will do - by maintaining our commitment to free and fair trade by keeping government spending down and by keeping taxes down Our economic life is not only test of our success overwhelms all others and that is issue of peace One issue Look at world on this bright August night The spirof Democracy is sweeping Pacific rim China feels winds of change New democracies assert themselves in South America One by one unfree places fall not to force of arms but to force of an idea freedom works We have a new relationship with Soviet Union The INF treaty - beginning of Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan - beginning of end of Soviet proxy war in Angola and with independence of Namibia Iran and Iraq move toward peace It is a watershed It is no accident It happened when we acted on ancient knowledge that strength and clarity lead to peace - weakness and ambivalence lead to war Weakness and ambivalence lead to war Weakness tempts aggressors Strength stops them will not allow this country to be made weak again The tremors in Soviet world continue The hard earth there has not yet settled Perhaps what is happening will change our world forever Perhaps what is happening will change our world forever Perhaps not A prudent skepticism is in order And so is hope Either way we're in an unprecedented position to change nature of our relationship Not by preemptive concession - but by keeping our strength Not by yielding up defense systems with nothing won in return - but by hard cool engagement in tug and pull of diplomacy My life has been lived in shadow of war - almost lost my life in one hate war love peace We have peace And am not going to let anyone take away from us Our economy is strong but not invulnerable and peace is broad but can be broken And now we must decide We will surely have change this year but will be change that moves us forward? Or change that risks retreat?In 1940 when was barely more than a boy Franklin Roosevelt said we shouldn't change horses in midstream My friends these days world moves even more quickly and now after two great terms a switch will be made But when you have to change horses in midstream doesn't make sense to switch to one who's going same way?An election that is about ideas and values is also about philosophy And have one At bright center is individual And radiating out from him or her is family essential unof closeness and of love For is family that communicates to our children - to 21st century - our culture our religious faith our traditions and history From individual to family to community and on out to town to church and school and still echoing out to county state nation - each doing only what does well and no more And believe that power must always be kept close to individual - close to hands that raise family and run home am guided by certain traditions One is that there is a God and He is good and his love while free has a self imposed cost We must be good to one another believe in another tradition that is by now embedded in national soul It is that learning is good in and of itself The mothers of Jewish ghettos of east would pour honey on a book so children would learn that learning is sweet And parents who settled hungry Kansas would take their children in from fields when a teacher came That is our history And there is another tradition And that is idea of community - a beautiful word with a big meaning Though liberal democrats have an odd view of They see \"\"community\"\" as a limited cluster of interest groups locked in odd conformity In this view country waits passive while Washington sets rules But that's not what community means - not to me For we are a nation of communities of thousands and tens of thousands of ethnic religious social business labor union neighborhood regional and other organizations all of them varied voluntary and unique This is America Knights of Columbus Grange Hadassah Disabled American Veterans Order of Ahepa Business and Professional Women of America union hall Bible study group LULAC \"\"Holy Name\"\" - a brilliant diversity spread like stars like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky Does government have a place? Yes Government is part of nation of communities - not whole just a part do not hate government A government that remembers that people are its master is a good and needed thing respect old fashioned common sense and have no great love for imaginings of social planners like what's been tested and found to be true For instance Should public school teachers be required to lead our children in pledge of allegiance? My opponent says no - but say yes Should society be allowed to impose death penalty on those who commcrimes of extraordinary cruelty and violence? My opponent says no - but say yes Should our children have right to say a voluntary prayer or even observe a moment of silence in schools? My opponent says no - but say yes Should free men and women have right to own a gun to protect their home? My opponent says no - but say yes Is right to believe in sanctity of life and protect lives of innocent children? My opponent says no - but say yes We must change from abortion - to adoption have an adopted granddaughter The day of her christening we wept with joy thank God her parents chose life I'm one who believes is a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a hardened first degree killer who hasn't even served enough time to be eligible for parole I'm one who says a drug dealer who is responsible for death of a policeman should be subject to capital punishment I'm one who won't raise taxes My opponent now says he'll raise them as a last resort or a third resort When a politician talks like that you know that's one resort he'll be checking into My opponent won't rule out raising taxes But will The Congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no and they'll push and I'll say no and they'll push again and I'll say to them \"\"Read my lips no new taxes \"\"Let me tell you more about mission On jobs my mission is 30 in 8 Thirty million jobs in next eight years Every one of our children deserves a first rate school The liberal democrats want power in hands of federal government want power in hands of parents will increase power of parents will encourage merschools will give more kids a Head Start And I'll make easier to save for college want a drug free America - and this will not be easy to achieve But want to enlist help of some people who are rarely included Tonight challenge young people of our country to shut down drug dealers around world Unite with us work with us \"\"Zero tolerance\"\" isn't just a policy it's an attitude Tell them what you think of people who underwrite dealers who put poison in our society And while you're doing that my administration will be telling dealers whatever we have to do we'll do but your day is over you're history am going to do whatever takes to make sure disabled are included in mainstream For too long they've been left out But they're not going to be left out anymore am going to stop ocean dumping Our beaches should not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools am going to have FB trace medical wastes and we are going to punish people who dump those infected needles into our oceans lakes and rivers And we must clean air We must reduce harm done by acid rain will put incentives back into domestic energy industry for know from personal experience there is no security for United States in further dependence on foreign oil In foreign affairs will continue our policy of peace through strength will move toward further cuts in strategic and conventional arsenals of both United States and Soviet Union will modernize and preserve our technological edge will ban chemical and biological weapons from face of earth And intend to speak for freedom stand for freedom and be a patient friend to anyone east or west who will fight for freedom It seems to me Presidency provides an incomparable opportunity for \"\"gentle persuasion \"\" hope to stand for a new harmony a greater tolerance We've come far but think we need a new harmony among races in our country We're on a journey to a new century and we've got to leave tired old baggage of bigotry behind Some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what it's for But they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth is an end in itself There are those who have dropped their standards along way as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to top There's graft in city hall greed on Wall Street; there's influence peddling in Washington and small corruptions of everyday ambition But you see believe public service is honorable And every time hear someone has breached public trust breaks my heart wonder sometimes if we have forgotten who we are But we're people who sundered a nation rather than allow a sin called slavery - we're people who rose from ghettos and deserts We weren't saints - but we lived by standards We celebrated individual - but we weren't self -centered We were practical - but we didn't live only for material things We believed in getting ahead - but blind ambition wasn't our way The fact is prosperity has a purpose It is to allow us to pursue \"\" better angels \"\" to give us time to think and grow Prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making concrete by certain acts of goodness It means helping a child from an unhappy home learn how to read - and thank my wife Barbara for all her work in literacy It means teaching troubled children through your presence that there's such a thing as reliable love Some would say it's soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things But where is written that we must act as if we do not care as if we are not moved?Well am moved want a kinder gentler nation Two men this year ask for your support And you must know us As for me have held high office and done work of democracy day by day My parents were prosperous; their children were lucky But there were lessons we had to learn about life John Kennedy discovered poverty when he campaigned in West Virginia; there were children there who had no milk Young Teddy Roosevelt met new America when he roamed immigrant streets of New York And learned a few things about life in a place called Texas We moved to west Texas 40 years ago The war was over and we wanted to get out and make on our own Those were exciting days Lived in a little shotgun house one room for three of us Worked in oil business started my own In time we had six children Moved from shotgun to a duplex apartment to a house Lived dream - high school football on Friday night Little League neighborhood barbecue People don't see their experience as symbolic of an era - but of course we were So was everyone else who was taking a chance and pushing into unknown territory with kids and a dog and a car But big thing learned is satisfaction of creating jobs which meant creating opportunity which meant happy families who in turn could do more to help others and enhance their own lives learned that good done by a single good job can be felt in ways you can't imagine may not be most eloquent but learned early that eloquence won't draw oil from ground may sometimes be a little awkward but there's nothing self-conscious in my love of country am a quiet man - but hear quiet people others don't The ones who raise family pay taxes meet mortgage hear them and am moved and their concerns are mine A must be many things He must be a shrewd protector of America's interests; And he must be an idealist who leads those who move for a freer and more democratic planet He must see to that government intrudes as little as possible in lives of people; and yet remember that is nation's character And he must be able to define - and lead - a mission For seven and a half years have worked with a - and have seen what crosses that big desk have seen unexpected crisis that arrive in a cable in a young aide's hand And have seen problems that simmer on for decades and suddenly demand resolution have seen modest decisions made with anguish and crucial decisions made with dispatch And so know that what all comes down to this election - what all comes down to after all shouting and cheers - is man at desk My friends am that man say without boast or bravado I've fought for my country I've served I've built - and will go from hills to hollows from cities to suburbs to loneliest town on quietest street to take our message of hope and growth for every American to every American will keep America moving forward always forward - for a better America for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points of light That is my mission And will complete God bless you\"

nearly 2 years United States nations of Latin America and Caribbean have worked together to resolve crisis in Panama The goals of United States have been to safeguard lives of Americans to defend democracy in Panama to combat drug trafficking and to protect integrity of Panama Canal treaty Many attempts have been made to resolve this crisis through diplomacy and negotiations All were rejected by dictator of Panama General Manuel Noriega an indicted drug trafficker Last Friday Noriega declared his military dictatorship to be in a state of war with United States and publicly threatened lives of Americans in Panama The very next day forces under his command shot and killed an unarmed American serviceman; wounded another; arrested and brutally beat a third American serviceman; and then brutally interrogated his wife threatening her with sexual abuse That was enough General Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in Panama created an imminent danger to 35 000 American citizens in Panama As have no higher obligation than to safeguard lives of American citizens And that is why directed our Armed Forces to protect lives of American citizens in Panama and to bring General Noriega to justice in United States contacted bipartisan leadership of Congress last night and informed them of this decision and after taking this action also talked with leaders in Latin America Caribbean and those of other U S allies At this moment U S forces including forces deployed from United States last night are engaged in action in Panama The United States intends to withdraw forces newly deployed to Panama as quickly as possible Our forces have conducted themselves courageously and selflessly And as Commander in Chief salute every one of them and thank them on behalf of our country Tragically some Americans have lost their lives in defense of their fellow citizens in defense of democracy And my heart goes out to their families We also regret and mourn loss of innocent Panamanians The brave Panamanians elected by people of Panama in elections last May Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Calderon and Ford have assumed rightful leadership of their country You remember those horrible pictures of newly elected Vice Ford covered head to toe with blood beaten mercilessly by so-called \"\"dignity battalions \"\" Well United States today recognizes democratically elected government of Endara will send our Ambassador back to Panama immediately Key military objectives have been achieved Most organized resistance has been eliminated but operation is not over yet General Noriega is in hiding And nevertheless yesterday a dictator ruled Panama and today constitutionally elected leaders govern have today directed Secretary of Treasury and Secretary of State to lift economic sanctions with respect to democratically elected government of Panama and in cooperation with that government to take steps to effect an orderly unblocking of Panamanian Government assets in United States I'm fully committed to implement Panama Canal treaties and turn over Canal to Panama in year 2000 The actions we have taken and cooperation of a new democratic government in Panama will permus to honor these commitments As soon as new government recommends a qualified candidate -- Panamanian -- to be Administrator of Canal as called for in treaties will submthis nominee to Senate for expedited consideration am committed to strengthening our relationship with democratic nations in this hemisphere will continue to seek solutions to problems of this region through dialog and multilateral diplomacy took this action only after reaching conclusion that every other avenue was closed and lives of American citizens were in grave danger hope that people of Panama will put this dark chapter of dictatorship behind them and move forward together as citizens of a democratic Panama with this government that they themselves have elected The United States is eager to work with Panamanian people in partnership and friendship to rebuild their economy The Panamanian people want democracy peace and chance for a better life in dignity and freedom The people of United States seek only to support them in pursuof these noble goals very much\"

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"Governor all very much for that welcome Good luck good luck to you ladies and gentlemen all Chairman McKenzie and Dr Adkisson and Dr Mobley for having me here And to Singing Cadets for that very special treat And to my Secretary of Commerce Bob Mosbacher I'm delighted that he's with me today want to pay my special respects to our Governor Bill Clements; to your Congressman from this district Joe Barton; and then of course to Senator Phil Gramm He said he taught economics here and in Congress It's hard to be humble But nevertheless -- laughter -- point is guy's telling truth and we are grateful to him every day for his leadership up there in Washington as we are for Joe Barton as well So we've got a good combination -- Phil Gramm in Senate and today Joe Barton in United States Congress -- a wonderful combination with these Aggie values in forefront was brought here today by an Aggie and brought him here to this marvelous ceremony with me He was mentioned by Congressman Barton but would like to ask pilot of Air Force One Lieutenant Colonel Dan Barr to stand up so you can see another Aggie all suited up up there And you met my day-to-day inside Aggie Fred McClure We work every minute of day on matters affecting legislative interests of this country but won't reintroduce Fred But am delighted to be back among my fellow Texans and friends And for those of you who are Democrats there is no truth to rumor that Phil Gramm and are ready to take our elephant walk Applause My sincerest congratulations go to every graduate and to your parents In this ceremony we celebrate nothing less than commencement of rest and best of your life And when you look back at your days at Texas A and M you will have a lot to be proud of a university that is first in baseball and first in service to our nation Many are heroes whose names are called at muster Many are those you remember in Silver Taps We are reminded that no generation can escape history Parents we share a fervent desire for our children and their children to know a better world a safer world And students your parents and grandparents have lived through a world war and helped America to rebuild world They witnessed drama of postwar nations divided by Soviet subversion and force but sustained by an allied response most vividly seen in Berlin airlift And today would like to use this joyous and solemn occasion to speak to you and to rest of country about our relations with Soviet Union It is fitting that these remarks be made here at Texas A and M University Wise men -- Truman and Eisenhower Vandenberg and Rayburn Marshall Acheson and Kennan -- crafted strategy of containment They believed that Soviet Union denied easy course of expansion would turn inward and address contradictions of its inefficient repressive and inhumane system And they were right -- Soviet Union is now publicly facing this hard reality Containment worked Containment worked because our democratic principles and institutions and values are sound and always have been It worked because our alliances were and are strong and because superiority of free societies and free markets over stagnant socialism is undeniable We are approaching conclusion of an historic postwar struggle between two visions one of tyranny and conflict and one of democracy and freedom The review of U S -Soviet relations that my administration has just completed outlines a new path toward resolving this struggle Our goal is bold more ambitious than any of my predecessors could have thought possible Our review indicates that 40 years of perseverance have brought us a precious opportunity and now is time to move beyond containment to a new policy for 1990s -- one that recognizes full scope of change taking place around world and in Soviet Union itself In sum United States now has as its goal much more than simply containing Soviet expansionism We seek integration of Soviet Union into community of nations And as Soviet Union itself moves toward greater openness and democratization as they meet challenge of responsible international behavior we will match their steps with steps of our own Ultimately our objective is to welcome Soviet Union back into world order The Soviet Union says that seeks to make peace with world and criticizes its own postwar policies These are words that we can only applaud but a new relationship cannot simply be declared by Moscow or bestowed by others; must be earned It must be earned because promises are never enough The Soviet Union has promised a more cooperative relationship before only to reverse course and return to militarism Soviet foreign policy has been almost seasonal warmth before cold thaw before freeze We seek a friendship that knows no season of suspicion no chill of distrust We hope em perestroika /em is pointing Soviet Union to a break with cycles of past -- a definitive break Who would have thought that we would see deliberations of Central Committee on front page of Pravda or dissident Andrei Sakharov seated near councils of power? Who would have imagined a Soviet leader who canvasses sidewalks of Moscow and also Washington D C ? These are hopeful indeed remarkable signs And let no one doubt our sincere desire to see em perestroika /em this reform continue and succeed But national security of America and our allies is not predicated on hope It must be based on deeds and we look for enduring ingrained economic and political change While we hope to move beyond containment we are only at beginning of our new path Many dangers and uncertainties are ahead We must not forget that Soviet Union has acquired awesome military capabilities That was a fact of life for my predecessors and that's always been a fact of life for our allies And that is a fact of life for me today as of United States As we seek peace we must also remain strong The purpose of our military might is not to pressure a weak Soviet economy or to seek military superiority It is to deter war It is to defend ourselves and our allies and to do something more to convince Soviet Union that there can be no reward in pursuing expansionism to convince Soviet Union that reward lies in pursuof peace Western policies must encourage evolution of Soviet Union toward an open society This task will test our strength It will tax our patience and will require a sweeping vision Let me share with you my vision see a Western Hemisphere of democratic prosperous nations no longer threatened by a Cuba or a Nicaragua armed by Moscow see a Soviet Union as pulls away from ties to terrorist nations like Libya that threaten legitimate security of their neighbors see a Soviet Union which respects China's integrity and returns northern territories to Japan a prelude to day when all great nations of Asia will live in harmony But fulfillment of this vision requires Soviet Union to take positive steps including First reduce Soviet forces Although some small steps have already been taken Warsaw Pact still possesses more than 30 000 tanks more than twice as much artillery and hundreds of thousands more troops in Europe than NATO They should cut their forces to less threatening levels in proportion to their legitimate security needs Second adhere to Soviet obligation promised in final days of World War I to support self-determination for all nations of Eastern Europe and central Europe And this requires specific abandonment of Brezhnev doctrine One day should be possible to drive from Moscow to Munich without seeing a single guard tower or a strand of barbed wire In short tear down Iron Curtain And third work with West in positive practical -- not merely rhetorical -- steps toward diplomatic solution to these regional disputes around world welcome Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and Angola agreement But there is much more to be done around world We're ready Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work And fourth achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for human rights Dramatic events have already occurred in Moscow We are impressed by limited but freely contested elections We are impressed by a greater toleration of dissent We are impressed by a new frankness about Stalin era Gorbachev don't stop now!And fifth join with us in addressing pressing global problems including international drug menace and dangers to environment We can build a better world for our children As Soviet Union moves toward arms reduction and reform will find willing partners in West We seek verifiable stabilizing arms control and arms reduction agreements with Soviet Union and its allies However arms control is not an end in itself but a means of contributing to security of America and peace of world directed Secretary of State Baker to propose to Soviets that we resume negotiations on strategic forces in June and as you know Soviet Union has agreed Our basic approach is clear In strategic arms reductions talks we wish to reduce risk of nuclear war And in companion defense and space talks our objective will be to preserve our options to deploy advanced defenses when they're ready In nuclear testing we will continue to seek necessary verification improvements in existing treaties to permthem to be brought into force And we're going to continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons We support NATO efforts to reduce Soviet offensive threat in negotiations on conventional forces in Europe And as I've said fundamental to all of these objectives is simple openness Make no mistake a new breeze is blowing across steppes and cities of Soviet Union Why not then let this spirof openness grow let more barriers come down Open emigration open debate open airwaves -- let openness come to mean publication and sale of banned books and newspapers in Soviet Union Let 19 000 Soviet Jews who emigrated last year be followed by any number who wish to emigrate this year And when people apply for exvisas let there be no harassment against them Let openness come to mean nothing less than free exchange of people and books and ideas between East and West And let come to mean one thing more Thirty-four years ago Eisenhower met in Geneva with Soviet leaders who after death of Stalin promised a new approach toward West He proposed a plan called Open Skies which would allow unarmed aircraft from United States and Soviet Union to fly over territory of other country This would open up military activities to regular scrutiny and as Eisenhower put \"\"convince world that we are lessening danger and relaxing tension \"\" Eisenhower's suggestion tested Soviet readiness to open their society and Kremlin failed that test Now let us again explore that proposal but on a broader more intrusive and radical basis -- one which hope would include allies on both sides We suggest that those countries that wish to examine this proposal meet soon to work out necessary operational details separately from other arms control negotiations Such surveillance flights complementing satellites would provide regular scrutiny for both sides Such unprecedented territorial access would show world true meaning of concept of openness The very Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitment to change Where there is cooperation there can be a broader economic relationship; but economic relations have been stifled by Soviet internal policies They've been injured by Moscow's practice of using cloak of commerce to steal technology from West Ending discriminatory treatment of U S firms would be a helpful step Trade and financial transactions should take place on a normal commercial basis And should Soviet Union codify its emigration laws in

to, you, and, to, rest, of, country, about, our, relations, with, soviet, union, it, is, fitting, that, these, remarks, be, made, here, at, texas, a, and, m, university, wise, men, --, truman, and, eisenhower, vandenberg, and, rayburn, marshall, acheson, and, kennan, --, crafted, strategy, of, containment, they, believed, that, soviet, union, denied, easy, course, of, expansion, would, turn, inward, and, address, contradictions, of, its, inefficient, repressive, and, inhumane, system, and, they, were, right, --, soviet, union, is, now, publicly, facing, this, hard, reality, containment, worked, containment, worked, because, our, democratic, principles, and, institutions, and, values, are, sound, and, always, have, been, it, worked, because, our, alliances, were, and, are, strong, and, because, superiority, of, free, societies, and, free, markets, over, stagnant, socialism, is, undeniable, we, are, approaching, conclusion, of, an, historic, postwar, struggle, between, two, visions, one, of, tyranny, and, conflict, and, one, of, democracy, and, freedom, the, review, of, u, s, -soviet, relations, that, my, administration, has, just, completed, outlines, a, new, path, toward, resolving, this, struggle, our, goal, is, bold, more, ambitious, than, any, of, my, predecessors, could, have, thought, possible, our, review, indicates, that, 40, years, of, perseverance, have, brought, us, a, precious, opportunity, and, now, is, time, to, move, beyond, containment, to, a, new, policy, for, 1990s, --, one, that, recognizes, full, scope, of, change, taking, place, around, world, and, in, soviet, union, itself, in, sum, united, states, now, has, as, its, goal, much, more, than, simply, containing, soviet, expansionism, we, seek, integration, of, soviet, union, into, community, of, nations, and, as, soviet, union, itself, moves, toward, greater, openness, and, democratization, as, they, meet, challenge, of, responsible, international, behavior, we, will, match, their, steps, with, steps, of, our, own, ultimately, our, objective, is, to, welcome, soviet, union, back, into, world, order, the, soviet, union, says, that, seeks, to, make, peace, with, world, and, criticizes, its, own, postwar, policies, these, are, words, that, we, can, only, applaud, but, a, new, relationship, cannot, simply, be, declared, by, moscow, or, bestowed, by, others;, must, be, earned, it, must, be, earned, because, promises, are, never, enough, the, soviet, union, has, promised, a, more, cooperative, relationship, before, only, to, reverse, course, and, return, to, militarism, soviet, foreign, policy, has, been, almost, seasonal, warmth, before, cold, thaw, before, freeze, we, seek, a, friendship, that, knows, no, season, of, suspicion, no, chill, of, distrust, we, hope, em, perestroika, /em, is, pointing, soviet, union, to, a, break, with, cycles, of, past, --, a, definitive, break, who, would, have, thought, that, we, would, see, deliberations, of, central, committee, on, front, page, of, pravda, or, dissident, andrei, sakharov, seated, near, councils, of, power?, who, would, have, imagined, a, soviet, leader, who, canvasses, sidewalks, of, moscow, and, also, washington, d, c, ?, these, are, hopeful, indeed, remarkable, signs, and, let, no, one, doubt, our, sincere, desire, to, see, em, perestroika, /em, this, reform, continue, and, succeed, but, national, security, of, america, and, our, allies, is, not, predicated, on, hope, it, must, be, based, on, deeds, and, we, look, for, enduring, ingrained, economic, and, political, change, while, we, hope, to, move, beyond, containment, we, are, only, at, beginning, of, our, new, path, many, dangers, and, uncertainties, are, ahead, we, must, not, forget, that, soviet, union, has, acquired, awesome, military, capabilities, that, was, a, fact, of, life, for, my, predecessors, and, that's, always, been, a, fact, of, life, for, our, allies, and, that, is, a, fact, of, life, for, me, today, as, of, united, states, as, we, seek, peace, we, must, also, remain, strong, the, purpose, of, our, military, might, is, not, to, pressure, a, weak, soviet, economy, or, to, seek, military, superiority, it, is, to, deter, war, it, is, to, defend, ourselves, and, our, allies, and, to, do, something, more, to, convince, soviet, union, that, there, can, be, no, reward, in, pursuing, expansionism, to, convince, soviet, union, that, reward, lies, in, pursuof, peace, western, policies, must, encourage, evolution, of, soviet, union, toward, an, open, society, this, task, will, test, our, strength, it, will, tax, our, patience, and, will, require, a, sweeping, vision, let, me, share, with, you, my, vision, see, a, western, hemisphere, of, democratic, prosperous, nations, no, longer, threatened, by, a, cuba, or, a, nicaragua, armed, by, moscow, see, a, soviet, union, as, pulls, away, from, ties, to, terrorist, nations, like, libya, that, threaten, legitimate, security, of, their, neighbors, see, a, soviet, union, which, respects, china's, integrity, and, returns, northern, territories, to, japan, a, prelude, to, day, when, all, great, nations, of, asia, will, live, in, harmony, but, fulfillment, of, this, vision, requires, soviet, union, to, take, positive, steps, including, first, reduce, soviet, forces, although, some, small, steps, have, already, been, taken, warsaw, pact, still, possesses, more, than, 30, 000, tanks, more, than, twice, as, much, artillery, and, hundreds, of, thousands, more, troops, in, europe, than, nato, they, should, cut, their, forces, to, less, threatening, levels, in, proportion, to, their, legitimate, security, needs, second, adhere, to, soviet, obligation, promised, in, final, days, of, world, war, i, to, support, self-determination, for, all, nations, of, eastern, europe, and, central, europe, and, this, requires, specific, abandonment, of, brezhnev, doctrine, one, day, should, be, possible, to, drive, from, moscow, to, munich, without, seeing, a, single, guard, tower, or, a, strand, of, barbed, wire, in, short, tear, down, iron, curtain, and, third, work, with, west, in, positive, practical, --, not, merely, rhetorical, --, steps, toward, diplomatic, solution, to, these, regional, disputes, around, world, welcome, soviet, withdrawal, from, afghanistan, and, angola, agreement, but, there, is, much, more, to, be, done, around, world, we're, ready, let's, roll, up, our, sleeves, and, get, to, work, and, fourth, achieve, a, lasting, political, pluralism, and, respect, for, human, rights, dramatic, events, have, already, occurred, in, moscow, we, are, impressed, by, limited, but, freely, contested, elections, we, are, impressed, by, a, greater, toleration, of, dissent, we, are, impressed, by, a, new, frankness, about, stalin, era, gorbachev, don't, stop, now!and, fifth, join, with, us, in, addressing, pressing, global, problems, including, international, drug, menace, and, dangers, to, environment, we, can, build, a, better, world, for, our, children, as, soviet, union, moves, toward, arms, reduction, and, reform, will, find, willing, partners, in, west, we, seek, verifiable, stabilizing, arms, control, and, arms, reduction, agreements, with, soviet, union, and, its, allies, however, arms, control, is, not, an, end, in, itself, but, a, means, of, contributing, to, security, of, america, and, peace, of, world, directed, secretary, of, state, baker, to, propose, to, soviets, that, we, resume, negotiations, on, strategic, forces, in, june, and, as, you, know, soviet, union, has, agreed, our, basic, approach, is, clear, in, strategic, arms, reductions, talks, we, wish, to, reduce, risk, of, nuclear, war, and, in, companion, defense, and, space, talks, our, objective, will, be, to, preserve, our, options, to, deploy, advanced, defenses, when, they're, ready, in, nuclear, testing, we, will, continue, to, seek, necessary, verification, improvements, in, existing, treaties, to, permthem, to, be, brought, into, force, and, we're, going, to, continue, to, seek, a, verifiable, global, ban, on, chemical, weapons, we, support, nato, efforts, to, reduce, soviet, offensive, threat, in, negotiations, on, conventional, forces, in, europe, and, as, i've, said, fundamental, to, all, of, these, objectives, is, simple, openness, make, no, mistake, a, new, breeze, is, blowing, across, steppes, and, cities, of, soviet, union, why, not, then, let, this, spirof, openness, grow, let, more, barriers, come, down, open, emigration, open, debate, open, airwaves, --, let, openness, come, to, mean, publication, and, sale, of, banned, books, and, newspapers, in, soviet, union, let, 19, 000, soviet, jews, who, emigrated, last, year, be, followed, by, any, number, who, wish, to, emigrate, this, year, and, when, people, apply, for, exvisas, let, there, be, no, harassment, against, them, let, openness, come, to, mean, nothing, less, than, free, exchange, of, people, and, books, and, ideas, between, east, and, west, and, let, come, to, mean, one, thing, more, thirty-four, years, ago, eisenhower, met, in, geneva, with, soviet, leaders, who, after, death, of, stalin, promised, a, new, approach, toward, west, he, proposed, a, plan, called, open, skies, which, would, allow, unarmed, aircraft, from, united, states, and, soviet, union, to, fly, over, territory, of, other, country, this, would, open, up, military, activities, to, regular, scrutiny, and, as, eisenhower, put, \"\"convince, world, that, we, are, lessening, danger, and, relaxing, tension, \"\", eisenhower's, suggestion, tested, soviet, readiness, to, open, their, society, and, kremlin, failed, that, test, now, let, us, again, explore, that, proposal, but, on, a, broader, more, intrusive, and, radical, basis, --, one, which, hope, would, include, allies, on, both, sides, we, suggest, that, those, countries, that, wish, to, examine, this, proposal, meet, soon, to, work, out, necessary, operational, details, separately, from, other, arms, control, negotiations, such, surveillance, flights, complementing, satellites, would, provide, regular, scrutiny, for, both, sides, such, unprecedented, territorial, access, would, show, world, true, meaning, of, concept, of, openness, the, very, soviet, willingness, to, embrace, such, a, concept, would, reveal, their, commitment, to, change, where, there, is, cooperation, there, can, be, a, broader, economic, relationship;, but, economic, relations, have, been, stifled, by, soviet, internal, policies, they've, been, injured, by, moscow's, practice, of, using, cloak, of, commerce, to, steal, technology, from, west, ending, discriminatory, treatment, of, u, s, firms, would, be, a, helpful, step, trade, and, financial, transactions, should, take, place, on, a, normal, commercial, basis, and, should, soviet, union, codify, its, emigration, laws, in, accord, with, international, standards, and, implement, its, new, laws, faithfully, am, prepared, to, work, with, congress, for, a, temporary, waiver, of, jackson-vanik, amendment, opening, way, to, extending, most, favored, nation, trade,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"and distinguished Members of House and Senate honored guests and fellow citizens Less than 3 weeks ago joined you on West Front of this very building and looking over monuments to our proud past offered you my hand in filling next page of American history with a story of extended prosperity and continued peace And tonight I'm back to offer you my plans as well The hand remains extended; sleeves are rolled up; America is waiting; and now we must produce Together we can build a better America It is comforting to return to this historic Chamber Here 22 years ago first raised my hand to be sworn into public life So tonight feel as if I'm returning home to friends And intend in months and years to come to give you what friends deserve frankness respect and my best judgment about ways to improve America's future In return ask for an honest commitment to our common mission of progress If we seize opportunities on road before us there'll be praise enough for all The people didn't send us here to bicker and it's time to govern And many Presidents have come to this Chamber in times of great crisis war and depression loss of national spir And 8 years ago sat in that very chair as Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates and people out of work -- American confidence on wane And our challenge is different We're fortunate -- a much changed landscape lies before us tonight So don't propose to reverse direction We're headed right way but we cannot rest We're a people whose energy and drive have fueled our rise to greatness And we're a forward-looking nation -- generous yes but ambitious not for ourselves but for world Complacency is not in our character -- not before not now not ever And so tonight we must take a strong America and make even better We must address some very real problems We must establish some very clear priorities And we must make a very substantial cut in Federal budget defic Some people find that agenda impossible but I'm presenting to you tonight a realistic plan for tackling My plan has four broad features attention to urgent priorities investment in future an attack on defic and no new taxes This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our priorities There are many areas in which we would all like to spend more than propose; understand that But we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order Next year alone thanks to economic growth without any change in law Federal Government will take in over $80 billion more than does this year That's right -- over $80 billion in new revenues with no increases in taxes And our job is to allocate those new resources wisely We can afford to increase spending by a modest amount but enough to invest in key priorities and still cut deficby almost 40 percent in 1 year And that will allow us to meet targets set forth in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law But to do that we must recognize that growth above inflation in Federal programs is not preordained that not all spending initiatives were designed to be immortal make this pledge tonight My team and are ready to work with Congress to form a special leadership group to negotiate in good faith to work day and night -- if that's what takes -- to meet budget targets and to produce a budget on time We cannot settle for business as usual Government by continuing resolution or government by crisis will not do And ask Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible We could save time and improve efficiency by enacting 2-year budgets Forty-three Governors have line-item veto Presidents should have too And at very least when a proposes to rescind Federal spending Congress should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing by inaction And ask Congress to honor public's wishes by passing a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget Such an amendment once phased in will discipline both Congress and executive branch Several principles describe kind of America hope to build with your help in years ahead We will not have luxury of taking easy spendthrift approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher taxes put economic growth at risk Economic growth provides jobs and hope Economic growth enables us to pay for social programs Economic growth enhances security of Nation and low tax rates create economic growth believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice And will work for choice for American families whether in housing in which they live schools to which they send their children or child care they select for their young You see believe that we have an obligation to those in need but that government should not be provider of first resort for things that private sector can produce better believe in a society that is free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind And will work to knock down barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again believe that family and faith represent moral compass of Nation And I'll work to make them strong for as Benjamin Franklin said \"\"If a sparrow cannot fall to ground without His notice can a great nation rise without His aid?\"\" And believe in giving people power to make their own lives better through growth and opportunity And together let's put power in hands of people Three weeks ago we celebrated bicentennial inaugural 200th anniversary of first Presidency And if you look back one thing is so striking about way Founding Fathers looked at America They didn't talk about themselves They talked about posterity They talked about future And we too must think in terms bigger than ourselves We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow We must extend American leadership in technology increase long-term investment improve our educational system and boost productivity These are keys to building a better future and here are some of my recommendations propose almost $2 2 billion for National Science Foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by 1993 propose to make permanent tax credfor research and development I've asked Vice Quayle to chair a new Task Force on Competitiveness And request funding for NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a strong space program an increase of almost $2 4 billion over current fiscal year We must have a manned space station; a vigorous safe space shuttle program; and more commercial development in space The space program should always go \"\"full throttle up \"\" And that's not just our ambition; it's our destiny propose that we cut maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase long-term investment History on this is clear -- this will increase revenues help savings and create new jobs We won't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of America behind This is year we should finally enact urban enterprise zones and bring hope to inner cities But most important competitiveness program of all is one which improves education in America When some of our students actually have trouble locating America on a map of world is time for us to map a new approach to education We must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy We must help schools that need help most We must give choice to parents students teachers and principals; and we must hold all concerned accountable In education we cannot tolerate mediocrity want to cut that dropout rate and make America a more literate nation because what really comes down to is this The longer our graduation lines are today shorter our unemployment lines will be tomorrow So tonight I'm proposing following initiatives beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best schools merschools; creation of special Presidential awards for best teachers in every State because excellence should be rewarded; establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars one each year for every Member of House and Senate to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; expanded use of magnet schools which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms I've said I'd like to be \"\"Education \"\" And tonight I'd ask you to join me by becoming \"\"Education Congress \"\" Just last week as settled into this new office received a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania who had been struck by my message in Inaugural Address \"\"Not 12 hours before \"\" she wrote \"\"my husband and = received word that our son was addicted to cocaine He had world at his feet Bright gifted personable -- he could have done anything with his life And now he has chosen cocaine \"\" \"\"And please \"\" she wrote \"\"find a way to curb supply of cocaine Get tough with pushers Our son needs your help \"\" My friends that voice crying out for help could be voice of your own neighbor your own friend your own son Over 23 million Americans used illegal drugs last year at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being Let this be recorded as time when America rose up and said no to drugs The scourge of drugs must be stopped And am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate war against drugs The war must be waged on all fronts Our new drug czar Bill Bennett and will be shoulder to shoulder in executive branch leading charge Some money will be used to expand treatment to poor and to young mothers This will offer helping hand to many innocent victims of drugs like thousands of babies born addicted or with AIDS because of mother's addiction Some will be used to cut waiting time for treatment Some money will be devoted to those urban schools where emergency is now worst And much of will be used to protect our borders with help from Coast Guard and Customs Service Departments of State and Justice and yes U S military mean to get tough on drug criminals And let me be clear This will back up those who put their lives on line every single day -- our local police officers My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution for a new attack on organized crime and for enforcement of tough sentences -- and for worst kingpins that means death penalty also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted there's a cell waiting for him And he should not go free because prisons are too full And so let word go out If you're caught and convicted you will do time But for all we do in law enforcement in interdiction and treatment we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop demand for drugs So some of this increase will be used to educate young about dangers of drugs We must involve parents We must involve teachers We must involve communities And my friends we must involve ourselves each and every one of us in this concern One problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and our continuing compassion and that is terrible tragedy of AIDS I'm asking for $1 6 billion for education to prevent disease and for research to find a cure If we're to protect our future we need a new attitude about environment We must protect air we brea will send to you shortly legislation for a new more effective Clean Air Act It will include a plan to reduce by date certain emissions which cause acid rain because time for study alone has passed and time for action is now We must make use of clean coal My budget contains full funding on schedule for clean coal technology agreement that we've made with Canada We've made that agreement with Canada and we intend to honor that agreement We must not neglect our parks So I'm asking to fund new acquisitions under Land and Water Conservation Fund We must protect our oceans And support new penalties against those who would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans The age of needle on beaches must end And in some cases gulfs and oceans off our shores hold promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil And when those with most promise can be tapped safely as with much of Alaska National Wildlife Refuge we should proceed But we must use caution; we must respect environment And so tonight I'm calling for indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions two off coast of California and one which could threaten Everglades in Florida Action on these three lease sales will awa conclusion of a special task force set up to measure potential for environmental damage I'm directing Attorney General and Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen enforcement of our laws against toxic-waste dumpers want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties against polluters In addition to caring for our future we must care for those around us A decent society shows compassion for young elderly vulnerable and poor Our first obligation is to most vulnerable -- infants poor mothers children living in poverty -- and my proposed budget recognizes this ask for full funding of Medicaid an increase of over $3 billion and an expansion of program to include coverage of pregnant women who are near poverty line believe we should help working families cope with burden of child care Our help should be aimed at those who need most low-income families with young children support a new child care tax credthat will aim our efforts at exactly those families without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home Now know there are competing proposals But remember this The overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors and churches and community groups Families who choose these options should remain eligible for help Parents should have choice And for those children who are unwanted or abused or whose parents are deceased we should encourage adoption propose to reenact tax deduction for adoption expenses and to double to $3 000 Let's make easier for these kids to have parents who love them We have a moral contract with our senior citizens And in this budget Social Security is fully funded including a full cost-of-living adjustment We must honor our contract We must care about those in shadow of life and like many Americans am deeply troubled by plight of homeless The causes of homelessness are many; history is long But moral imperative to act is clear Thanks to deep well of generosity in this great land many organizations already contribute but we in government cannot stand on sidelines In my budget ask for greater support for emergency food and shelter for health services and measures to prevent substance abuse and for clinics for mentally ill And propose a new initiative involving full range of government agencies We must confront this national shame There's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight I've long believed that people of Puerto Rico should have right to determine their own political future Personally strongly favor statehood But urge Congress to take necessary steps to allow people to decide in a referendum Certain problems result of decades of unwise practices threaten health and security of our people Left unattended they will only get worse But we can act now to put them behind us Earlier this week announced my support for a plan to restore financial and moral integrity of our savings system ask Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days We must not let this situation fester We owe to savers in this country to solve this problem Certainly savings of Americans must remain secure Let me be clear Insured depositors will continue to be fully protected but any plan to refinance system must be accompanied by major reform Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring The best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again The majority of thrifts in communities across Nation have been honest They've played a major role in helping families achieve dream of home ownership But make no mistake those who are corrupt those who break law must be kicked out of business; and they should go to jail We face a massive task in cleaning up waste left from decades of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants Clearly we must modernize these plants and operate them safely That's not at issue; our national security depends on But beyond that we must clean up old mess that's been left behind And propose in this budget to more than double our current effort to do so This will allow us to identify exact nature of various problems so we can clean them up and clean them up we will We've been fortunate during these past 8 years America is a stronger nation than was in 1980 Morale in our Armed Forces has been restored; our resolve has been shown Our readiness has been improved and we are at peace There can no longer be any doubt that peace has been made more secure through strength And when America is stronger world is safer Most people don't realize that after successful restoration of our strength Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of last 4 years We cannot tolerate continued real reduction in defense In light of compelling need to reduce defic however support a 1-year freeze in military budget something proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan And this freeze will apply for only 1 year and after that increases above inflation will be required will not sacrifice American preparedness and will not compromise American strength should be clear on conditions attached to my recommendation for coming year The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I've spoken about tonight This defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meets targets spelled out in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes and which incorporates reforms in budget process I've directed National Security Council to review our national security and defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies I'm also charging Department of Defense with task of developing a plan to improve defense procurement process and management of Pentagon one which will fully implement Packard commission report Many of these changes can only be made with participation of Congress and so ask for your help We need fewer regulations We need less bureaucracy We need multiyear procurement and 2-year budgeting And frankly -- and don't take this wrong -- we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy detect a slight division on that question but nevertheless -- laughter Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps most important priority I'd like to address tonight You know we meet at a time of extraordinary hope Never before in this century have our values of freedom democracy and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around globe Never before has our leadership been so crucial because while America has its eyes on future world has its eyes on America And it's a time of great change in world and especially in Soviet Union Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand full meaning of change going on there review our policies and then proceed with caution But I've personally assured General Secretary Gorbachev that at conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward We will not miss any opportunity to work for peace The fundamental facts remain that Soviets retain a very powerful military machine in service of objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours So let us take new openness seriously but let's also be realistic And let's always be strong There are some pressing issues we must address will vigorously pursue Strategic Defense Initiative The spread and even use of sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before Chemical weapons must be banned from face of Earth never to be used again And look this won't be easy Verification -- extraordinarily difficult but civilization and human decency demand that we try And spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped And I'll work to strengthen hand of International Atomic Energy Agency Our diplomacy must work every day against proliferation of nuclear weapons And around globe we must continue to be freedom's best friend And we must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in Central America including in Nicaragua It is my strongly held conviction that when people are given chance they inevitably will choose a free press freedom of worship and certifiably free and fair elections We must strengthen alliance of industrial democracies as solid a force for peace as world has ever known And this is an alliance forged by power of our ideals not pettiness of our differences So let's lift our sights to rise above fighting about beef hormones to building a better future to move from protectionism to progress I've asked Secretary of State to visEurope next week and to consult with our allies on wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together including East-West relations And look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in near future And too shall begin a trip shortly to far reaches of Pacific Basin where winds of democracy are creating new hope and power of free markets is unleashing a new force When served as our representative in China 14 or 15 years ago few would have predicted scope of changes we've witnessed since then But in preparing for this trip was struck by something came across from a Chinese writer He was speaking of his country decades ago but his words speak to each of us in America tonight \"\"Today \"\" he said \"\"we're afraid of simple words like 'goodness' and 'mercy' and 'kindness '\"\" My friends if we're to succeed as a nation we must rediscover those words In just 3 days we mark birthday of Abraham Lincoln man who saved our Union and gave new meaning to word \"\"opportunity \"\" Lincoln once said \"\" hold that while man exists is his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorating that of mankind \"\" It is this broader mission to which call all Americans because definition of a successful life must include serving others And to young people of America who sometimes feel left out ask you tonight to give us benefof your talent and energy through a new program called YES for Youth Entering Service to America To those men and women in business remember ultimate end of your work to make a better product to create better lives ask you to plan for longer term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profits To brave men and women who wear uniform of United States of America Your calling is a high one to be defenders of freedom and guarantors of liberty And want you to know that this nation is grateful for your service To farmers of America we appreciate bounty you provide We will work with you to open foreign markets to American agricultural products And to parents of America ask you to get involved in your child's schooling Check on homework go to school meet teachers care about what is happening there It's not only your child's future on line it's America's To kids in our cities don't give up hope Say no to drugs; stay in school And yes \"\"Keep hope alive \"\" To those 37 million Americans with some form of disability you belong in economic mainstream We need your talents in America's work force Disabled Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity society To families of America watching tonight in your living rooms hold fast to your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands And to my friends in this Chamber ask your cooperation to keep America growing while cutting defic That's only fair to those who now have no vote generations to come Let them look back and say that we had foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not time to rest but a time to press forward a time to invest in future And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity human energy and untiring hope of human spir believe this would not have asked to be your if didn't And tomorrow debate on plan I've put forward begins and ask Congress to come forward with your own proposals Let's not question each other's motives Let's debate let's negotiate; but let us solve problem Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches -- laughter -- but tonight is one of some note On February 9th 1941 just 48 years ago tonight Sir Winston Churchill took to airwaves during Britain's hour of peril He'd received from Roosevelt a hand-carried letter quoting Longfellow's famous poem \"\"Sail on O Ship of State! Sail on O Union strong and great! Humanity with all its fears With all hopes of future years Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\"\" And Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt \"\"We shall not fail or falter \"\" he said \"\"We shall not weaken or tire Give us tools and we will finish job \"\" Tonight almost half a century later our peril may be less immediate but need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great Now as then there are those who say can't be done There are voices who say that America's best days have passed that we're bound by constraints threatened by problems surrounded by troubles which limour ability to hope Well tonight remain full of hope We Americans have only begun on our mission of goodness and greatness And to those timid souls repeat plea \"\"Give us tools and we will do job \"\" God bless you and God bless America\"

no, increases, in, taxes, and, our, job, is, to, allocate, those, new, resources, wisely, we, can, afford, to, increase, spending, by, a, modest, amount, but, enough, to, invest, in, key, priorities, and, still, cut, deficby, almost, 40, percent, in, 1, year, and, that, will, allow, us, to, meet, targets, set, forth, in, gramm-rudman-hollings, law, but, to, do, that, we, must, recognize, that, growth, above, inflation, in, federal, programs, is, not, preordained, that, not, all, spending, initiatives, were, designed, to, be, immortal, make, this, pledge, tonight, my, team, and, are, ready, to, work, with, congress, to, form, a, special, leadership, group, to, negotiate, in, good, faith, to, work, day, and, night, --, if, that's, what, takes, --, to, meet, budget, targets, and, to,

will, work, for, choice, for, american, families, whether, in, housing, in, which, they, live, schools, to, which, they, send, their, children, or, child, care, they, select, for, their, young, you, see, believe, that, we, have, an, obligation, to, those, in, need, but, that, government, should, not, be, provider, of, first, resort, for, things, that, private, sector, can, produce, better, believe, in, a, society, that, is, free, from, discrimination, and, bigotry, of, any, kind, and, will, work, to, knock, down, barriers, left, by, past, discrimination, and, to, build, a, more, tolerant, society, that, will, stop, such, barriers, from, ever, being, built, again, believe, that, family, and, faith, represent, moral, compass, of, nation, and, i'll, work, to, make, them, strong, for, as, benjamin, franklin, said, \"\"if, a, sparrow, cannot, fall, to, ground, without, his, notice, can, a, great, nation, rise, without, his, aid?\"\", and, believe, in, giving, people, power, to, make, their, own, lives, better, through, growth, and, opportunity, and, together, let's, put, power, in, hands, of, people, three, weeks, ago, we, celebrated, bicentennial, inaugural, 200th, anniversary, of, first, presidency, and, if, you, look, back, one, thing, is, so, striking, about, way, founding, fathers, looked, at, america, they, didn't, talk, about, themselves, they, talked, about, posterity, they, talked, about, future, and, we, too, must, think, in, terms, bigger, than, ourselves, we, must, take, actions, today, that, will, ensure, a, better, tomorrow, we, must, extend, american, leadership, in, technology, increase, long-term, investment, improve, our, educational, system, and, boost, productivity, these, are, keys, to, building, a, better, future, and, here, are, some, of, my, recommendations, propose, almost, $2, 2, billion, for, national, science, foundation, to, promote, basic, research, and, keep, us, on, track, to, double, its, budget, by, 1993, propose, to, make, permanent, tax, credfor, research, and, development, i've, asked, vice, quayle, to, chair, a, new, task, force, on, competitiveness, and, request, funding, for, nasa, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, and, a, strong, space, program, an, increase, of, almost, $2, 4, billion, over, current, fiscal, year, we, must, have, a, manned, space, station;, a, vigorous, safe, space, shuttle, program;, and, more, commercial, development, in, space, the, space, program, should, always, go, \"\"full, throttle, up, \"\", and, that's, not, just, our, ambition;, it's, our, destiny, propose, that, we, cut, maximum, tax, rate, on, capital, gains, to, increase, long-term, investment, history, on, this, is, clear, --, this, will, increase, revenues, help, savings, and, create, new, jobs, we, won't, be, competitive, if, we, leave, whole, sectors, of, america, behind, this, is, year, we, should, finally, enact, urban, enterprise, zones, and, bring, hope, to, inner, cities, but, most, important, competitiveness, program, of, all, is, one, which, improves, education, in, america, when, some, of, our, students, actually, have, trouble, locating, america, on, a, map, of, world, is, time, for, us, to, map, a, new, approach, to, education, we, must, reward, excellence, and, cut, through, bureaucracy, we, must, help, schools, that, need, help, most, we, must, give, choice, to, parents, students, teachers, and, principals;, and, we, must, hold, all, concerned, accountable, in, education, we, cannot, tolerate, mediocrity, want, to, cut, that, dropout, rate, and, make, america, a, more, literate, nation, because, what, really, comes, down, to, is, this, the, longer, our, graduation, lines, are, today, shorter, our, unemployment, lines, will, be, tomorrow, so, tonight, i'm, proposing, following, initiatives, beginning, of, a, $500, million, program, to, reward, america's, best, schools, merschools;, creation, of, special, presidential, awards, for, best, teachers, in, every, state, because, excellence, should, be, rewarded;, establishment, of, a, new, program, of, national, science, scholars, one, each, year, for, every, member, of, house, and, senate, to, give, this, generation, of, students, a, special, incentive, to, excel, in, science, and, mathematics;, expanded, use, of, magnet, schools, which, give, families, and, students, greater, choice;, and, a, new, program, to, encourage, alternative, certification, which, will, let, talented, people, from, all, fields, teach, in, our, classrooms, i've, said, i'd, like, to, be, \"\"education, \"\", and, tonight, i'd, ask, you, to, join, me, by, becoming, \"\"education, congress, \"\", just, last, week, as, settled, into, this, new, office, received, a, letter, from, a, mother, in, pennsylvania, who, had, been, struck, by, my, message, in, inaugural, address, \"\"not, 12, hours, before, \"\", she, wrote, \"\"my, husband, and, =, received, word, that, our, son, was, addicted, to, cocaine, he, had, world, at, his, feet, bright, gifted, personable, --, he, could, have, done, anything, with, his, life, and, now, he, has, chosen, cocaine, \"\", \"\"and, please, \"\", she, wrote, \"\"find, a, way, to, curb, supply, of, cocaine, get, tough, with, pushers, our, son, needs, your, help, \"\", my, friends, that, voice, crying, out, for, help, could, be, voice, of, your, own, neighbor, your, own, friend, your, own, son, over, 23, million, americans, used, illegal, drugs, last, year, at, a, staggering, cost, to, our, nation's, well-being, let, this, be, recorded, as, time, when, america, rose, up, and, said, no, to, drugs, the, scourge, of, drugs, must, be, stopped, and, am, asking, tonight, for, an, increase, of, almost, a, billion, dollars, in, budget, outlays, to, escalate, war, against, drugs, the, war, must, be, waged, on, all, fronts, our, new, drug, czar, bill, bennett, and, will, be, shoulder, to, shoulder, in, executive, branch, leading, charge, some, money, will, be, used, to, expand, treatment, to, poor, and, to, young, mothers, this, will, offer, helping, hand, to, many, innocent, victims, of, drugs, like, thousands, of, babies, born, addicted, or, with, aids, because, of, mother's, addiction, some, will, be, used, to, cut, waiting, time, for, treatment, some, money, will, be, devoted, to, those, urban, schools, where, emergency, is, now, worst, and, much, of, will, be, used, to, protect, our, borders, with, help, from, coast, guard, and, customs, service, departments, of, state, and, justice, and, yes, u, s, military, mean, to, get, tough, on, drug, criminals, and, let, me, be, clear, this, will, back, up, those, who, put, their, lives, on, line, every, single, day, --, our, local, police, officers, my, budget, asks, for, beefed-up, prosecution, for, a, new, attack, on, organized, crime, and, for, enforcement, of, tough, sentences, --, and, for, worst, kingpins, that, means, death, penalty, also, want, to, make, sure, that, when, a, drug, dealer, is, convicted, there's, a, cell, waiting, for, him, and, he, should, not, go, free, because, prisons, are, too, full, and, so, let, word, go, out, if, you're, caught, and, convicted, you, will, do, time, but, for, all, we, do, in, law, enforcement, in, interdiction, and, treatment, we, will, never, win, this, war, on, drugs, unless, we, stop, demand, for, drugs, so, some, of, this, increase, will, be, used, to, educate, young, about, dangers, of, drugs, we, must, involve, parents, we, must, involve, teachers, we, must, involve, communities, and, my, friends, we, must, involve, ourselves, each, and, every, one, of, us, in, this, concern, one, problem, related, to, drug, use, demands, our, urgent, attention, and, our, continuing, compassion, and, that, is, terrible, tragedy, of, aids, i'm, asking, for, $1, 6, billion, for, education, to, prevent, disease, and, for, research, to, find, a, cure, if, we're, to, protect, our, future, we, need, a, new, attitude, about, environment, we, must, protect, air, we, brea, will, send, to, you, shortly, legislation, for, a, new, more, effective, clean, air, act, it, will, include, a, plan, to, reduce, by, date, certain, emissions, which, cause, acid, rain, because, time, for, study, alone, has, passed, and, time, for, action, is, now, we, must, make, use, of, clean, coal, my, budget, contains, full, funding, on, schedule, for, clean, coal, technology, agreement, that, we've, made, with, canada, we've, made, that, agreement, with, canada, and, we, intend, to, honor, that, agreement, we, must, not, neglect, our, parks, so, i'm, asking, to, fund, new, acquisitions, under, land, and, water, conservation, fund, we, must, protect, our, oceans, and, support, new, penalties, against, those, who, would, dump, medical, waste, and, other, trash, into, our, oceans, the, age, of, needle, on, beaches, must, end, and, in, some, cases, gulfs, and, oceans, off, our, shores, hold, promise, of, oil, and, gas, reserves, which, can, make, our, nation, more, secure, and, less, dependent, on, foreign, oil, and, when, those, with, most, promise, can, be, tapped, safely, as, with, much, of, alaska, national, wildlife, refuge, we, should, proceed, but, we, must, use, caution;, we, must, respect, environment, and, so, tonight, i'm, calling, for, indefinite, postponement, of, three, lease, sales, which, have, raised, troubling, questions, two, off, coast, of, california, and, one, which, could, threaten, everglades, in, florida, action, on, these, three, lease, sales, will, awa, conclusion, of, a, special, task, force, set, up, to, measure, potential, for, environmental, damage, i'm, directing, attorney, general, and, administrator, of, environmental, protection, agency, to, use, every, tool, at, their, disposal, to, speed, and, toughen, enforcement, of, our, laws, against, toxic-waste, dumpers, want, faster, cleanups, and, tougher, enforcement, of, penalties, against, polluters, in, addition, to, caring, for, our, future, we, must, care, for, those, around, us, a, decent, society, shows, compassion, for, young, elderly, vulnerable, and, poor, our, first, obligation, is, to, most, vulnerable, --, infants, poor, mothers, children, living, in, poverty, --, and, my, proposed, budget, recognizes, this, ask, for, full, funding, of, medicaid, an, increase, of, over, $3, billion, and, an, expansion, of, program, to, include, coverage, of, pregnant, women, who, are, near, poverty, line, believe, we, should, help, working, families, cope, with, burden, of, child, care, our, help, should, be, aimed, at, those, who, need, most, low-income, families, with, young, children, support, a, new, child, care, tax, credthat, will, aim, our, efforts, at, exactly, those, families, without, discriminating, against, mothers, who, choose, to, stay, at, home, now, know, there, are, competing, proposals, but, remember, this, the, overwhelming, majority, of, all, preschool, child, care, is, now, provided, by, relatives, and, neighbors, and, churches, and, community, groups, families, who, choose, these, options, should, remain, eligible, for, help, parents, should, have, choice, and, for, those, children, who, are, unwanted, or, abused, or, whose, parents, are, deceased, we, should, encourage, adoption, propose, to, reenact, tax, deduction, for, adoption, expenses, and, to, double, to, $3, 000, let's, make, easier, for, these, kids, to, have, parents, who, love, them, we, have, a, moral, contract, with, our, senior, citizens, and, in, this, budget, social, security, is, fully, funded, including, a, full, cost-of-living, adjustment, we, must, honor, our, contract, we, must, care, about, those, in, shadow, of, life, and, like, many, americans, am, deeply, troubled, by, plight, of, homeless, the, causes, of, homelessness, are, many;, history, is, long, but, moral, imperative, to, act, is, clear, thanks, to, deep, well, of, generosity, in, this, great, land, many, organizations, already, contribute, but, we, in, government, cannot, stand, on, sidelines, in, my, budget, ask, for, greater, support, for, emergency, food, and, shelter, for, health, services, and, measures, to, prevent, substance, abuse, and, for, clinics, for, mentally, ill, and, propose, a, new, initiative, involving, full, range, of, government, agencies, we, must, confront, this, national, shame, there's, another, issue, that, i've, decided, to, mention, here, tonight, i've, long, believed, that, people, of, puerto, rico, should, have, right, to, determine, their, own, political, future, personally, strongly, favor, statehood, but, urge, congress, to, take, necessary, steps, to, allow, people, to, decide, in, a, referendum, certain, problems, result, of, decades, of, unwise, practices, threaten, health, and, security, of, our, people, left, unattended, they, will, only, get, worse, but, we, can, act, now, to, put, them, behind, us, earlier, this, week, announced, my, support, for, a, plan, to, restore, financial, and, moral, integrity, of, our, savings, system, ask, congress, to, enact, our, reform, proposals, within, 45, days, we, must, not, let, this, situation, fester, we, owe, to, savers, in, this, country, to, solve, this, problem, certainly, savings, of, americans, must, remain, secure, let, me, be, clear, insured, depositors, will, continue, to, be, fully, protected, but, any, plan, to, refinance, system, must, be, accompanied, by, major, reform, our, proposals, will, prevent, such, a, crisis, from, recurring, the, best, answer, is, to, make, sure, that, a, mess, like, this, will, never, happen, again, the, majority, of, thrifts, in, communities, across, nation, have, been, honest, they've, played, a, major, role, in, helping, families, achieve, dream, of, home, ownership, but, make, no, mistake, those, who, are, corrupt, those, who, break, law, must, be, kicked, out, of, business;, and, they, should, go, to, jail, we, face, a, massive, task, in, cleaning, up, waste, left, from, decades, of, environmental, neglect, at, america's, nuclear, weapons, plants, clearly, we, must, modernize, these, plants, and, operate, them, safely, that's, not, at, issue;, our, national, security, depends, on, but, beyond, that, we, must, clean, up, old, mess, that's, been, left, behind, and, propose, in, this, budget, to, more, than, double, our, current, effort, to, do, so, this, will, allow, us, to, identify, exact, nature, of, various, problems, so, we, can, clean, them, up, and, clean, them, up, we, will, we've, been, fortunate, during, these, past, 8, years, america, is, a, stronger, nation, than, was, in, 1980, morale, in, our, armed, forces, has, been, restored;, our, resolve, has, been, shown, our, readiness, has, been, improved, and, we, are, at, peace, there, can, no, longer, be, any, doubt, that, peace, has, been, made, more, secure, through, strength, and, when, america, is, stronger, world, is, safer, most, people, don't, realize, that, after, successful, restoration, of, our, strength, pentagon, budget, has, actually, been, reduced, in, real, terms, for, each, of, last, 4, years, we, cannot, tolerate, continued, real, reduction, in, defense, in, light, of, compelling, need, to, reduce, defic, however, support, a, 1-year, freeze, in, military, budget, something, proposed, last, fall, in, my, flexible, freeze, plan, and, this, freeze, will, apply, for, only, 1, year, and, after, that, increases, above, inflation, will, be, required, will, not, sacrifice, american, preparedness, and, will, not, compromise, american, strength, should, be, clear, on, conditions, attached, to, my, recommendation, for, coming, year, the, savings, must, be, allocated, to, those, priorities, for, investing, in, our, future, that, i've, spoken, about, tonight, this, defense, freeze, must, be, a, part, of, a, comprehensive, budget, agreement, which, meets, targets, spelled, out, in, gramm-rudman-hollings, law, without, raising, taxes, and, which, incorporates, reforms, in, budget, process, i've, directed, national, security, council, to, review, our, national, security, and, defense, policies, and, report, back, to, me, within, 90, days, to, ensure, that, our, capabilities, and, resources, meet, our, commitments, and, strategies, i'm, also, charging, department, of, defense, with, task, of, developing, a, plan, to, improve, defense, procurement, process, and, management, of, pentagon, one, which, will, fully, implement, packard, commission, report, many, of, these, changes, can, only, be, made, with, participation, of, congress, and, so, ask, for, your, help, we, need, fewer, regulations, we, need, less, bureaucracy, we, need, multiyear, procurement, and, 2-year, budgeting, and, frankly, --, and, don't, take, this, wrong, --, we, need, less, congressional, micromanagement, of, our, nation's, military, policy, detect, a, slight, division, on, that, question, but, nevertheless, --, laughter, securing, a, more, peaceful, world, is, perhaps, most, important, priority, i'd, like, to, address, tonight, you, know, we, meet, at, a, time, of, extraordinary, hope, never, before, in, this, century, have, our, values, of, freedom, democracy, and, economic, opportunity, been, such, a, powerful, and, intellectual, force, around, globe, never, before, has, our, leadership, been, so, crucial, because, while, america, has, its, eyes, on, future, world, has, its, eyes, on, america, and, it's, a, time, of, great, change, in, world, and, especially, in, soviet, union, prudence, and, common, sense, dictate, that, we, try, to, understand, full, meaning, of, change, going, on, there, review, our, policies, and, then, proceed, with, caution, but, i've, personally, assured, general, secretary, gorbachev, that, at, conclusion, of, such, a, review, we, will, be, ready, to, move, forward, we, will, not, miss, any, opportunity, to, work, for, peace, the, fundamental, facts, remain, that, soviets, retain, a, very, powerful, military, machine, in, service, of, objectives, which, are, still, too, often, in, conflict, with, ours, so, let, us, take, new, openness, seriously, but, let's, also, be, realistic, and, let's, always, be, strong, there, are, some, pressing, issues, we, must, address, will, vigorously, pursue, strategic, defense, initiative, the, spread, and, even, use, of, sophisticated, weaponry, threatens, global, security, as, never, before, chemical, weapons, must, be, banned, from, face, of, earth, never, to, be, used, again, and, look, this, won't, be, easy, verification, --, extraordinarily, difficult, but, civilization, and, human, decency, demand, that, we, try, and, spread, of, nuclear, weapons, must, be, stopped, and, i'll, work, to, strengthen, hand, of, international, atomic, energy, agency, our, diplomacy, must, work, every, day, against, proliferation, of, nuclear, weapons, and, around, globe, we, must, continue, to, be, freedom's, best, friend, and, we, must, stand, firm, for, self-determination, and, democracy, in, central, america, including, in, nicaragua, it, is, my, strongly, held, conviction, that, when, people, are, given, chance, they, inevitably, will, choose, a, free, press, freedom, of, worship, and, certifiably, free, and, fair, elections, we, must, strengthen, alliance, of, industrial, democracies, as, solid, a, force, for, peace, as, world, has, ever, known, and, this, is, an, alliance, forged, by, power, of, our, ideals, not, pettiness, of, our, differences, so, let's, lift, our, sights, to, rise, above, fighting, about, beef, hormones, to, building, a, better, future, to, move, from, protectionism, to, progress, i've, asked, secretary, of, state, to, viseurope, next, week, and, to, consult, with, our, allies, on, wide, range, of, challenges, and, opportunities, we, face, together, including, east-west, relations, and, look, forward, to, meeting, with, our, nato, partners, in, near, future, and, too, shall, begin, a, trip, shortly, to, far, reaches, of, pacific, basin, where, winds, of, democracy, are, creating, new, hope, and, power, of, free, markets, is, unleashing, a, new, force, when, served, as, our, representative, in, china, 14, or, 15, years, ago, few, would, have, predicted, scope, of, changes, we've, witnessed, since, then, but, in, preparing, for, this, trip, was, struck, by, something, came, across, from, a, chinese, writer, he, was, speaking, of, his, country, decades, ago, but, his, words, speak, to, each, of, us, in, america, tonight, \"\"today, \"\", he, said, \"\"we're, afraid, of, simple, words, like, 'goodness', and, 'mercy', and, 'kindness, '\"\", my, friends, if, we're, to, succeed, as, a, nation, we, must, rediscover, those, words, in, just, 3, days, we, mark, birthday, of, abraham, lincoln, man, who, saved, our, union, and, gave, new, meaning, to, word, \"\"opportunity, \"\", lincoln, once, said, \"\", hold, that, while, man, exists, is, his, duty, to, improve, not, only, his, own, condition, but, to, assist, in, ameliorating, that, of, mankind, \"\", it, is, this, broader, mission, to, which, call, all, americans, because, definition, of, a, successful, life, must, include, serving, others, and, to, young, people, of, america, who, sometimes, feel, left, out, ask, you, tonight, to, give, us, benefof, your, talent, and, energy, through, a, new, program, called, yes, for, youth, entering, service, to, america, to, those, men, and, women, in, business, remember, ultimate, end, of, your, work, to, make, a, better, product, to, create, better, lives, ask, you, to, plan, for, longer, term, and, avoid, that, temptation, of, quick, and, easy, paper, profits, to, brave, men, and, women, who, wear, uniform, of, united, states, of, america, your, calling, is, a, high, one, to, be, defenders, of, freedom, and, guarantors, of, liberty, and, want, you, to, know, that, this, nation, is, grateful, for, your, service, to, farmers, of, america, we, appreciate, bounty, you, provide, we, will, work, with, you, to, open, foreign, markets, to, american, agricultural, products, and, to, parents, of, america, ask, you, to, get, involved, in, your, child's, schooling, check, on, homework, go, to, school, meet, teachers, care, about, what, is, happening, there, it's, not, only, your, child's, future, on, line, it's, america's, to, kids, in, our, cities, don't, give, up, hope, say, no, to, drugs;, stay, in, school, and, yes, \"\"keep, hope, alive, \"\", to, those, 37, million, americans, with, some, form, of, disability, you, belong, in, economic, mainstream, we, need, your, talents, in, america's, work, force, disabled, americans, must, become, full, partners, in, america's, opportunity, society, to, families, of, america, watching, tonight, in, your, living, rooms, hold, fast, to, your, dreams, because, ultimately, america's, future, rests, in, your, hands, and, to, my, friends, in, this, chamber, ask, your, cooperation, to, keep, america, growing, while, cutting, defic, that's, only, fair, to, those, who, now, have, no, vote, generations, to, come, let, them, look, back, and, say, that, we, had, foresight, to, understand, that, a, time, of, peace, and, prosperity, is, not, time, to, rest, but, a, time, to, press, forward, a, time, to, invest, in, future, and, let, all, americans, remember, that, no, problem, of, human, making, is, too, great, to, be, overcome, by, human, ingenuity, human, energy, and, untiring, hope, of, human, spir, believe, this, would, not, have, asked, to, be, your, if, didn't, and, tomorrow, debate, on, plan, i've, put, forward, begins, and, ask, congress, to, come, forward, with, your, own, proposals, let's, not, question, each, other's, motives, let's, debate, let's, negotiate;, but, let, us, solve, problem, recalling, anniversaries, may, not, be, my, specialty, in, speeches, --, laughter, --, but, tonight, is, one, of, some, note, on, february, 9th, 1941, just, 48, years, ago, tonight, sir, winston, churchill, took, to, airwaves, during, britain's, hour, of, peril, he'd, received, from, roosevelt, a, hand-carried, letter, quoting, longfellow's, famous, poem, \"\"sail, on, o, ship, of, state!, sail, on, o, union, strong, and, great!, humanity, with, all, its, fears, with, all, hopes, of, future, years, is, hanging, breathless, on, thy, fate!\"\", and, churchill, responded, on, this, night, by, radio, broadcast, to, a, nation, at, war, but, he, directed, his, words, to, franklin, roosevelt, \"\"we, shall, not, fail, or, falter, \"\", he, said, \"\"we, shall, not, weaken, or, tire, give, us, tools, and, we, will, finish, job, \"\", tonight, almost, half, a, century, later, our, peril, may, be, less, immediate, but, need, for, perseverance, and, clear-sighted, fortitude, is, just, as, great, now, as, then, there, are, those, who, say, can't, be, done, there, are, voices, who,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"members of United States Congress return as a former of Senate and a former member of this great House And now as is my privilege to report to you on state of Union Tonight come not to speak about state of government not to detail every new initiative we plan for coming year nor to describe every line in budget I'm here to speak to you and to American people about state of Union about our world -- changes we've seen challenges we face -- and what that means for America There are singular moments in history dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after And many of us in this chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945; and events of that year decreed shape of nations pace of progress freedom or oppression for millions of people around world Nineteen forty-five provided common frame of reference compass points of postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves And that was our world until now The events of year just ended Revolution of '89 have been a chain reaction changes so striking that marks beginning of a new era in world's affairs Think back -- think back just 12 short months ago to world we knew as 1989 began One year -- one year ago people of Panama lived in fear under thumb of a dictator Today democracy is restored; Panama is free Operation Just Cause has achieved its objective The number of military personnel in Panama is now very close to what was before operation began And tonight am announcing that well before end of February additional numbers of American troops brave men and women of our armed forces who made this mission a success will be back home A year ago in Poland Lech Walesa declared that he was ready to open a dialog with Communist rulers of that country; and today with future of a free Poland in their own hands members of Solidarity lead Polish government A year ago freedom's playwright Vaclav Havel languished as a prisoner in Prague And today it's Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia And one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide and he predicted Berlin Wall would last another hundred years And today less than one year later it's Wall that's history Remarkable events -- events that fulfill long-held hopes of American people; events that validate longstanding goals of American policy a policy based on a single shining principle cause of freedom America not just nation but an idea alive in minds of people everywhere As this new world takes shape America stands at center of a widening circle of freedom -- today tomorrow and into next century Our nation is enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores and millions still struggling to be free This nation this idea called America was and always will be a new world -- our new world At a workers' rally in a place called Branik on outskirts of Prague idea called America is alive A worker dressed in grimy overalls rises to speak at factory gates He begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words words of a distant revolution \"\"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights and that among these are Life Liberty and pursuof Happiness \"\"It's no secret that here at home freedom's door opened long ago The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place democracy competition opportunity private investment stewardship and of course leadership And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours a system second to none and make better a better America where there's a job for everyone who wants one; where women working outside home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care and where government works to expand child-care alternatives for parents; where we reconcile needs of a clean environment and a strong economy; where \"\"Made in USA\"\" is recognized around world as symbol of quality and progress; where every one of us enjoys same opportunities to live to work and to contribute to society and where for first time American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens; where everyone has a roof over his head and where homeless get help they need to live in dignity; where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers and where all of them make grade; where every street every city every school and every child is drug-free; and finally where no American is forgotten -- our hearts go out to our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and in our efforts That's part of future we want to see future we can make for ourselves but dreams alone won't get us there We need to extend our horizon commto long view And our mission for future starts today In tough competitive markets around world America faces great challenges and great opportunities And we know that we can succeed in global economic arena of nineties but to meet that challenge we must make some fundamental changes -- some crucial investment in ourselves Yes we are going to invest in America This administration is determined to encourage creation of capital capital of all kinds physical capital -- everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services; intellectual capital -- source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products; and of course our human capital -- talented work force that we'll need to compete in global market Let me tell you if we ignore human capital if we lose spirof American ingenuity spirthat is hallmark of American worker that would be bad The American worker is most productive worker in world We need to save more We need to expand pool of capital for new investments that need more jobs and more growth And that's idea behind a new initiative call Family Savings Plan which will send to Congress tomorrow We need to cut tax on capital gains encourage risktakers especially those in our small businesses to take those steps that translate into economic reward jobs and a better life for all of us We'll do what takes to invest in America's future The budget commitment is there The money is there It's there for research and development R and D -- a record high It's there for our housing initiative -- HOPE -- to help everyone from first-time homebuyers to homeless The money's there to keep our kids drug-free -- 70 percent more than when took office in 1989 It's there for space exploration And it's there for education -- another record high And one more thing Last fall at education summ Governors and agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn very first day they walk into classroom And I've made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds -- an extra half-a-billion dollars -- for something near and dear to all of us Head Start Education is one investment that means more for our future because means most for our children Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more It's a matter of asking more -- expecting more -- of our schools our teachers of our kids of our parents and ourselves And that's why tonight am announcing America's education goals goals developed with enormous cooperation from Nation's Governors And if might I'd like to say I'm very pleased that Governor Gardner Washington and Governor Clinton Arkansas Governor Branstad Iowa Governor Campbell South Carolina all of whom were very key in these discussions these deliberations are with us here tonight By year 2000 every child must start school ready to learn The United States must increase high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something In critical subjects -- at 4th 8th and 12th grades -- we must assess our students' performance By year 2000 U S students must be first in world in math and science achievement Every American adult must be a skilled literate worker and citizen Every school must offer kind of disciplined environment that makes possible for our kids to learn And every school in America must be drug-free Ambitious aims? Of course Easy to do? Far from But future's at stake The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education These investments will keep America competitive And know this about American people We welcome competition We'll match our ingenuity our energy our experience and technology our spirand enterprise against anyone But let competition be free but let also be fair America is ready Since we really mean and since we're serious about being ready to meet that challenge we're getting our own house in order We have made real progress Seven years ago federal deficwas 6 percent of our gross national product -- 6 percent In new budget sent up two days ago deficis down to 1 percent of gross national product That budget brings federal spending under control It meets Gramm-Rudman target It brings that deficdown further and balances budget by 1993 with no new taxes And let me tell you there's still more than enough federal spending For most of us $1 2 trillion is still a lot of money And once budget is balanced we can operate way every family must when has bills to pay We won't leave to our children and our grandchildren Once it's balanced we will start paying off national debt And there's something more we owe generations of future stewardship safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance It's just one sign of how serious we are We will elevate Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank -- not more bureaucracy not more redtape but certainty that here at home and especially in our dealings with other nations environmental issues have status they deserve This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our environment with over $1 billion for global change research and a new initiative call America Beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves that improve recreational facilities on public lands and something else something that will help keep this country clean from our forestland to inner cities and keep America beautiful for generations to come money to plant a billion trees a year And tonight let me say again to all members of Congress The American people did not send us here to bicker There is work to do and they sent us here to get done And once again in spirof cooperation offer my hand to all of you Let's work together to do will of people clean air child care Educational Excellence Act crime and drugs It's time to act The farm bill transportation policy product-liability reform enterprise zones -- it's time to act together And there's one thing hope we will be able to agree on It's about our commitments I'm talking about Social Security To every American out there on Social Security to every American supporting that system today and to everyone counting on when they retire we made a promise to you and we are going to keep We rescued system in 1983 and it's sound again -- bipartisan arrangement Our budget fully funds today's benefits and assures that future benefits will be funded as well The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security There's one more problem we need to address We must give careful consideration to recommendations of health-care studies underway now That's why tonight I'm asking Dr Sullivan Lou Sullivan Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on quality accessibility and cost of our nation's health-care system am committed to bring staggering costs of health care under control The state of government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber But state of Union depends on all Americans We must maintain democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals I've been appalled at recent mail bombings across this country Every one of us must confront and condemn racism anti-Semitism bigotry and hate not next week not tomorrow but right now -- every single one of us The state of Union depends on whether we help our neighbor -- claim problems of our community as our own We've got to step forward when there's trouble lend a hand be what call a point of light to a stranger in need We've got to take time after a busy day to sdown and read with our kids help them with their homework pass along values we learned as children That's how we sustain state of Union Every effort is important It all adds up It's doing things that give democracy meaning It all adds up to who we are and who we will be Let me say that so long as we remember American idea so long as we live up to American ideal state of Union will remain sound and strong And to those who worry that we've lost our way -- well want you to listen to parts of a letter written by Private First Class James Markwell a 20-year-old Army medic of 1st Battalion 75th Rangers It's dated December 18 night before our armed forces went into action in Panama It's a letter servicemen write and hope will never be sent And sadly Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter She passed along to me out there in Cincinnati And here is some of what he wrote \"\"I've never been afraid of death but know he is waiting at corner I've been trained to kill and to save and so has everyone else am frightened what lays beyond fog and yet do not mourn for me Revel in life that have died to give you But most of all don't forget Army was my choice Something that wanted to do Remember joined Army to serve my country and ensure that you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely \"\"Let me add that Private Markwell was among first to see battle in Panama and one of first to fall But he knew what he believed in He carried idea we call America in his heart began tonight speaking about changes we've seen this past year There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us and there's a need for leadership that only America can provide Nearly 40 years ago in his last address to Congress Harry Truman predicted such a time would come He said \"\"As our world grows stronger more united more attractive to men on both sides of Iron Curtain then inevitably there will come a time of change within Communist world \"\" Today that change is taking place For more than 40 years America and its allies held communism in check and ensured that democracy would continue to exist And today with communism crumbling our aim must be to ensure democracy's advance to take lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope a great and growing commonwealth of free nations And to Congress and to all Americans say is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad a common vision of peaceful world we want to see Here in our own hemisphere is time for all peoples of Americas North and South to live in freedom In Far East and Africa it's time for full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served as engine of progress It's time to offer our hand to emerging democracies of Eastern Europe so that continent -- for too long a continent divided -- can see a future whole and free It's time to build on our new relationship with Soviet Union to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity We are in a period of great transition great hope and yet great uncertainty We recognize that Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization Therefore we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and Strategic Defense Initiative But time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe a coherent defense program that ensures U S will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe And I've consulted with leaders of NATO In fact spoke by phone with Gorbachev just today agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that should not be tied solely to Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe But our troop levels can still be lower And so tonight am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in U S and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195 000 on each side This level reflects advice of our senior military advisers It's designed to protect American and European interests and sustain NATO's defense strategy A swift conclusion to our arms control talks -- conventional chemical and strategic -- must now be our goal And that time has come Still we must recognize an unfortunate fact In many regions of world tonight reality is conflict not peace Enduring animosities and opposing interests remain And thus cause of peace must be served by an America strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our ideals It's this American idea that for past four decades helped inspire this Revolution of '89 Here at home and in world there's history in making history to be made Six months ago early in this season of change stood at gates of Gdansk shipyard in Poland at monument to fallen workers of Solidarity It's a monument of simple majesty Three tall crosses rise up from stones and atop each cross an anchor -- an ancient symbol of hope The anchor in our world today is freedom holding us steady in times of change a symbol of hope to all world And freedom is at very heart of idea that is America Giving life to that idea depends on every one of us Our anchor has always been faith and family In last few days of this past momentous year our family was blessed once more celebrating joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild When held little guy for first time troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable and totally in perspective Now know you're probably thinking well that's just a grandfather talking Well maybe you're right But I've met a lot of children this past year across this country as all of you have everywhere from Far East to Eastern Europe And all kids are unique and yet all kids are alike -- budding young environmentalists met this month who joined me in exploring Florida Everglades; little leaguers played catch with in Poland ready to go from Warsaw to World Series; and even kids who are ill or alone -- and God bless those boarder babies born addicted to drugs and AIDS and coping with problems no child should have to face But you know when comes to hope and future every kid is same -- full of dreams ready to take on world -- all special because they are very future of freedom And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking about And so tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you Now let me start with my generation with grandparents out there You are our living link to past Tell your grandchildren story of struggles waged at home and abroad of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake And tell them your own story as well because every American has a story to tell And parents your children look to you for direction and guidance Tell them of faith and family Tell them we are one nation under God Teach them that of all many gifts they can receive liberty is their most precious legacy and of all gifts they can give greatest is helping others And to children and young people out there tonight With you rests our hope all that America will mean in years and decades ahead Fix your vision on a new century -- your century on dreams we cannot see on destiny that is yours and yours alone And finally let all Americans -- all of us together here in this chamber symbolic center of democracy -- affirm our allegiance to this idea we call America And let us remember that state of Union depends on each and every one of us God bless all of you and may God bless this great nation United States of America\"

skilled, literate, worker, and, citizen, every, school, must, offer, kind, of, disciplined, environment, that, makes, possible, for, our, kids, to, learn, and, every, school, in, america, must, be, drug-free, ambitious, aims?, of, course, easy, to, do?, far, from, but, future's, at, stake, the, nation, will, not, accept, anything, less, than, excellence, in, education, these, investments, will, keep, america, competitive, and, know, this, about, american, people, we, welcome, competition, we'll, match, our, ingenuity, our, energy, our, experience, and, technology, our, spirand, enterprise, against, anyone, but, let, competition, be, free, but, let, also, be, fair, america, is, ready, since, we, really, mean, and, since, we're, serious, about, being, ready, to, meet, that, challenge, we're, getting, our, own, house, in, order, we, have, made, real, progress, seven, years, ago, federal, deficwas, 6, percent, of, our, gross, national, product, --, 6, percent, in, new, budget, sent, up, two, days, ago, deficis, down, to, 1, percent, of, gross, national, product, that, budget, brings, federal, spending, under, control, it, meets, gramm-rudman, target, it, brings, that, deficdown, further, and, balances, budget, by, 1993, with, no, new, taxes, and, let, me, tell, you, there's, still, more, than, enough, federal, spending, for, most, of, us, $1, 2, trillion, is, still, a, lot, of, money, and, once, budget, is, balanced, we, can, operate, way, every, family, must, when, has, bills, to, pay, we, won't, leave, to, our, children, and, our, grandchildren, once, it's, balanced, we, will, start, paying, off, national, debt, and, there's, something, more, we, owe, generations, of, future, stewardship, safekeeping, of, america's, precious, environmental, inheritance, it's, just, one, sign, of, how, serious, we, are, we, will, elevate, environmental, protection, agency, to, cabinet, rank, --, not, more, bureaucracy, not, more, redtape, but, certainty, that, here, at, home, and, especially, in, our, dealings, with, other, nations, environmental, issues, have, status, they, deserve, this, year's, budget, provides, over, $2, billion, in, new, spending, to, protect, our, environment, with, over, $1, billion, for, global, change, research, and, a, new, initiative, call, america, beautiful, to, expand, our, national, parks, and, wildlife, preserves, that, improve, recreational, facilities, on, public, lands, and, something, else, something, that, will, help, keep, this, country, clean, from, our, forestland, to, inner, cities, and, keep, america, beautiful, for, generations, to, come, money, to, plant, a, billion, trees, a, year, and, tonight, let, me, say, again, to, all, members, of, congress, the, american, people, did, not, send, us, here, to, bicker, there, is, work, to, do, and, they, sent, us, here, to, get, done, and, once, again, in, spirof, cooperation, offer, my, hand, to, all, of, you, let's, work, together, to, do, will, of,

time, to, act, together, and, there's, one, thing, hope, we, will, be, able, to, agree, on, it's, about, our, commitments, i'm, talking, about, social, security, to, every, american, out, there, on, social, security, to, every, american, supporting, that, system, today, and, to, everyone, counting, on, when, they, retire, we, made, a, promise, to, you, and, we, are, going, to, keep, we, rescued, system, in, 1983, and, it's, sound, again, --, bipartisan, arrangement, our, budget, fully, funds, today's, benefits, and, assures, that, future, benefits, will, be, funded, as, well, the, last, thing, we, need, to, do, is, mess, around, with, social, security, there's, one, more, problem, we, need, to, address, we, must, give, careful, consideration, to, recommendations, of, health-care, studies, underway, now, that's, why, tonight, i'm, asking, dr, sullivan, lou, sullivan, secretary, of, health, and, human, services, to, lead, a, domestic, policy, council, review, of, recommendations, on, quality, accessibility, and, cost, of, our, nation's, health-care, system, am, committed, to, bring, staggering, costs, of, health, care, under, control, the, state, of,

of, millions, of, individuals, i've, been, appalled, at, recent, mail, bombings, across, this, country, every, one, of, us, must, confront, and, condemn, racism, anti-semitism, bigotry, and, hate, not, next, week, not, tomorrow, but, right, now, --, every, single, one, of, us, the, state, of, union, depends, on, whether, we, help, our, neighbor, --, claim, problems, of, our, community, as, our, own, we've, got, to, step, forward, when, there's, trouble, lend, a, hand, be, what, call, a, point, of, light, to, a, stranger, in, need, we've, got, to, take, time, after, a, busy, day, to, sdown, and, read, with, our, kids, help, them, with, their, homework, pass, along, values, we, learned, as, children, that's, how, we, sustain, state, of, union, every, effort, is, important, it, all, adds, up, it's, doing, things, that, give, democracy, meaning, it, all, adds, up, to, who, we, are, and, who, we, will, be, let, me, say, that, so, long, as, we, remember, american, idea, so, long, as, we, live, up, to, american, ideal, state, of, union, will, remain, sound, and, strong, and, to, those, who, worry, that, we've, lost, our, way, --, well, want, you, to, listen, to, parts, of, a, letter, written, by, private, first, class, james, markwell, a, 20-year-old, army, medic, of, 1st, battalion, 75th, rangers, it's, dated, december, 18, night, before, our, armed, forces, went, into, action, in, panama, it's, a, letter, servicemen, write, and, hope, will, never, be, sent, and, sadly, private, markwell's, mother, did, receive, this, letter, she, passed, along, to, me, out, there, in, cincinnati, and, here, is, some, of, what, he, wrote, \"\"i've, never, been, afraid, of, death, but, know, he, is, waiting, at, corner, i've, been, trained, to, kill, and, to, save, and, so, has, everyone, else, am, frightened, what, lays, beyond, fog, and, yet, do, not, mourn, for, me, revel, in, life, that, have, died, to, give, you, but, most, of, all, don't, forget, army, was, my, choice, something, that, wanted, to, do, remember, joined, army, to, serve, my, country, and, ensure, that, you, are, free, to, do, what, you, want, and, live, your, lives, freely, \"\"let, me, add, that, private, markwell, was, among, first, to, see, battle, in, panama, and, one, of, first, to, fall, but, he, knew, what, he, believed, in, he, carried, idea, we, call, america, in, his, heart, began, tonight, speaking, about, changes, we've, seen, this, past, year, there, is, a, new, world, of, challenges, and, opportunities, before, us, and, there's, a, need, for, leadership, that, only, america, can, provide, nearly, 40, years, ago, in, his, last, address, to, congress, harry, truman, predicted, such, a, time, would, come, he, said, \"\"as, our, world, grows, stronger, more, united, more, attractive, to, men, on, both, sides, of, iron, curtain, then, inevitably, there, will, come, a, time, of, change, within, communist, world, \"\", today, that, change, is, taking, place, for, more, than, 40, years, america, and, its, allies, held, communism, in, check, and, ensured, that, democracy, would, continue, to, exist, and, today, with, communism, crumbling, our, aim, must, be, to, ensure, democracy's, advance, to, take, lead, in, forging, peace, and, freedom's, best, hope, a, great, and, growing, commonwealth, of, free, nations, and, to, congress, and, to, all, americans, say, is, time, to, acclaim, a, new, consensus, at, home, and, abroad, a, common, vision, of, peaceful, world, we, want, to, see, here, in, our, own, hemisphere, is, time, for, all, peoples, of, americas, north, and, south, to, live, in, freedom, in, far, east, and, africa, it's, time, for, full, flowering, of, free, governments, and, free, markets, that, have, served, as, engine, of, progress, it's, time, to, offer, our, hand, to, emerging, democracies, of, eastern, europe, so, that, continent, --, for, too, long, a, continent, divided, --, can, see, a, future, whole, and, free, it's, time, to, build, on, our, new, relationship, with, soviet, union, to, endorse, and, encourage, a, peaceful, process, of, internal, change, toward, democracy, and, economic, opportunity, we, are, in, a, period, of, great, transition, great, hope, and, yet, great, uncertainty, we, recognize, that, soviet, military, threat, in, europe, is, diminishing, but, we, see, little, change, in, soviet, strategic, modernization, therefore, we, must, sustain, our, own, strategic, offense, modernization, and, strategic, defense, initiative, but, time, is, right, to, move, forward, on, a, conventional, arms, control, agreement, to, move, us, to, more, appropriate, levels, of, military, forces, in, europe, a, coherent, defense, program, that, ensures, u, s, will, continue, to, be, a, catalyst, for, peaceful, change, in, europe, and, i've, consulted, with, leaders, of, nato, in, fact, spoke, by, phone, with, gorbachev, just, today, agree, with, our, european, allies, that, an, american, military, presence, in, europe, is, essential, and, that, should, not, be, tied, solely, to, soviet, military, presence, in, eastern, europe, but, our, troop, levels, can, still, be, lower, and, so, tonight, am, announcing, a, major, new, step, for, a, further, reduction, in, u, s, and, soviet, manpower, in, central, and, eastern, europe, to, 195, 000, on, each, side, this, level, reflects, advice, of, our, senior, military, advisers, it's, designed, to, protect, american, and, european, interests, and, sustain, nato's, defense, strategy, a, swift, conclusion, to, our, arms, control, talks, --, conventional, chemical, and, strategic, --, must, now, be, our, goal, and, that, time, has, come, still, we, must, recognize, an, unfortunate, fact, in, many, regions, of, world, tonight, reality, is, conflict, not, peace, enduring, animosities, and, opposing, interests, remain, and, thus, cause, of, peace, must, be, served, by, an, america, strong, enough, and, sure, enough, to, defend, our, interests, and, our, ideals, it's, this, american, idea, that, for, past, four, decades, helped, inspire, this, revolution, of, '89, here, at, home, and, in, world, there's, history, in, making, history, to, be, made, six, months, ago, early, in, this, season, of, change, stood, at, gates, of, gdansk, shipyard, in, poland, at, monument, to, fallen, workers, of, solidarity, it's, a, monument, of, simple, majesty, three, tall, crosses, rise, up, from, stones, and, atop, each, cross, an, anchor, --, an, ancient, symbol, of, hope, the, anchor, in, our, world, today, is, freedom, holding, us, steady, in, times, of, change, a, symbol, of, hope, to, all, world, and, freedom, is, at, very, heart, of, idea, that, is, america, giving, life, to, that, idea, depends, on, every, one, of, us, our, anchor, has, always, been, faith, and, family, in, last, few, days, of, this, past, momentous, year, our, family, was, blessed, once, more, celebrating, joy, of, life, when, a, little, boy, became, our, 12th, grandchild, when, held, little, guy, for, first, time, troubles, at, home, and, abroad, seemed, manageable, and, totally, in, perspective, now, know, you're, probably, thinking, well, that's, just, a, grandfather, talking, well, maybe, you're, right, but, i've, met, a, lot, of, children, this, past, year, across, this, country, as, all, of, you, have, everywhere, from, far, east, to, eastern, europe, and, all, kids, are, unique, and, yet, all, kids, are, alike, --, budding, young, environmentalists, met, this, month, who, joined, me, in, exploring, florida, everglades;, little, leaguers, played, catch, with, in, poland, ready, to, go, from, warsaw, to, world, series;, and, even, kids, who, are, ill, or, alone, --, and, god, bless, those, boarder, babies, born, addicted, to, drugs, and, aids, and, coping, with, problems, no, child, should, have, to, face, but, you, know, when, comes, to, hope, and, future, every, kid, is, same, --, full, of, dreams, ready, to, take, on, world, --, all, special, because, they, are, very, future, of, freedom, and, to, them, belongs, this, new, world, i've, been, speaking, about, and, so, tonight, i'm, going, to, ask, something, of, every, one, of, you, now, let, me, start, with, my, generation, with, grandparents, out, there, you, are, our, living, link, to, past, tell, your, grandchildren, story, of, struggles, waged, at, home, and, abroad, of, sacrifices, freely, made, for, freedom's, sake, and, tell, them, your, own, story, as, well, because, every, american, has, a, story, to, tell, and, parents, your, children, look, to, you, for, direction, and, guidance, tell, them, of, faith, and, family, tell, them, we, are, one, nation, under, god, teach, them, that, of, all, many, gifts, they, can, receive, liberty, is, their, most, precious, legacy, and, of, all, gifts, they, can, give, greatest, is, helping, others, and, to, children, and, young, people, out, there, tonight, with, you, rests, our, hope, all, that, america, will, mean, in, years, and, decades, ahead, fix, your, vision, on, a, new, century, --, your, century, on, dreams, we, cannot, see, on, destiny, that, is, yours, and, yours, alone, and, finally, let, all, americans, --, all, of, us, together, here, in, this, chamber, symbolic, center, of, democracy, --, affirm, our, allegiance, to, this, idea, we, call, america, and, let, us, remember, that, state, of, union, depends, on, each, and, every, one, of, us, god, bless, all, of, you, and, may, god, bless, this, great, nation, united, states, of, america\"]

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"Evan so much And welcome to every one of you out there in this splendid scene of hope spread across South Lawn of White House want to salute Members of United States Congress House and Senate who are with us today -- active participants in making this day come true This is indeed an incredible day -- especially for thousands of people across Nation who have given so much of their time their vision and their courage to see this act become a reality You know started trying to put together a list of all people who should be mentioned today But when list started looking a little longer than Senate testimony for bill decided better give up or that we'd never get out of here before sunset So even though so many deserve cred will single out but a tiny handful And take those who have guided me personally over years of course my friends Evan Kemp and Justin Dart up here on platform with me; and of course -- hope you'll forgive me for also saying a special word of thanks to two from White House but again this is personal so don't want to offend those omitted -- two from White House Boyden Gray and Bill Roper who labored long and hard And want to thank Sandy Parrino of course for her leadership And again -- is very risky with all these Members of Congress here who worked so hard but can say on a very personal basis Bob Dole has inspired me This is an immensely important day a day that belongs to all of you Everywhere look see people who have dedicated themselves to making sure that this day would come to pass my friends from Congress as say who worked so diligently with best interest of all at heart Democrats and Republicans; members of this administration -- and I'm pleased to see so many top officials and members of my Cabinet here today who brought their caring and expertise to this fight; and then organizations -- so many dedicated organizations for people with disabilities who gave their time and their strength; and perhaps most of all everyone out there and others -- across breadth of this nation are 43 million Americans with disabilities You have made this happen All of you have made this happen To all of you just want to say your triumph is that your bill will now be law and that this day belongs to you On behalf of our nation very very much Three weeks ago we celebrated our nation's Independence Day Today we're here to rejoice in and celebrate another \"\"independence day \"\" one that is long overdue With today's signing of landmark Americans for Disabilities Act every man woman and child with a disability can now pass through once-closed doors into a bright new era of equality independence and freedom As look around at all these joyous faces remember clearly how many years of dedicated commitment have gone into making this historic new civil rights act a reality It's been work of a true coalition a strong and inspiring coalition of people who have shared both a dream and a passionate determination to make that dream come true It's been a coalition in finest spir-- a joining of Democrats and Republicans of legislative and executive branches of Federal and State agencies of public officials and private citizens of people with disabilities and without This historic act is world's first comprehensive declaration of equality for people with disabilities -- first Its passage has made United States international leader on this human rights issue Already leaders of several other countries including Sweden Japan Soviet Union and all 12 members of EEC have announced that they hope to enact now similar legislation Our success with this act proves that we are keeping faith with spirof our courageous forefathers who wrote in Declaration of Independence \"\"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights \"\" These words have been our guide for more than two centuries as we've labored to form our more perfect union But tragically for too many Americans blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied The Civil Rights Act of '64 took a bold step towards righting that wrong But stark fact remained that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination and this was intolerable Today's legislation brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life liberty and pursuof happiness This act is powerful in its simplicity It will ensure that people with disabilities are given basic guarantees for which they have worked so long and so hard independence freedom of choice control of their lives opportunity to blend fully and equally into rich mosaic of American mainstream Legally will provide our disabled community with a powerful expansion of protections and then basic civil rights It will guarantee fair and just access to fruits of American life which we all must be able to enjoy And then specifically first ADA ensures that employers covered by act cannot discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities Second ADA ensures access to public accommodations such as restaurants hotels shopping centers and offices And third ADA ensures expanded access to transportation services And fourth ADA ensures equivalent telephone services for people with speech or hearing impediments These provisions mean so much to so many To one brave girl in particular they will mean world Lisa Carl a young Washington State woman with cerebral palsy who I'm told is with us today now will always be admitted to her hometown theater Lisa you might not have been welcome at your theater but I'll tell you -- welcome to White House We're glad you're here The ADA is a dramatic renewal not only for those with disabilities but for all of us because along with precious privilege of being an American comes a sacred duty to ensure that every other American's rights are also guaranteed Together we must remove physical barriers we have created and social barriers that we have accepted For ours will never be a truly prosperous nation until all within prosper For inspiration we need look no further than our own neighbors With us in that wonderful crowd out there are people representing 18 of daily Points of Light that I've named for their extraordinary involvement with disabled community We applaud you and your shining example for your leadership for all that are here today Now let me just tell you a wonderful story a story about children already working in spirof ADA -- a story that really touched me Across Nation some 10 000 youngsters with disabilities are part of Little League's Challenger Division Their teams play just like others but -- and this is most remarkable part -- as they play at their sides are volunteer buddies from conventional Little League teams All of these players work together They team up to wheel around bases and to field grounders together and most of all just to play and become friends We must let these children be our guides and inspiration also want to say a special word to our friends in business community You have in your hands key to success of this act for you can unlock a splendid resource of untapped human potential that when freed will enrich us all know there have been concerns that ADA may be vague or costly or may lead endlessly to litigation But want to reassure you right now that my administration and United States Congress have carefully crafted this Act We've all been determined to ensure that gives flexibility particularly in terms of timetable of implementation and we've been committed to containing costs that may be incurred This act does something important for American business though -- and remember this You've called for new sources of workers Well many of our fellow citizens with disabilities are unemployed They want to work and they can work and this is a tremendous pool of people And remember this is a tremendous pool of people who will bring to jobs diversity loyalty proven low turnover rate and only one request chance to prove themselves And when you add together Federal State local and private funds costs almost $200 billion annually to support Americans with disabilities -- in effect to keep them dependent Well when given opportunity to be independent they will move proudly into economic mainstream of American life and that's what this legislation is all about Our problems are large but our unified heart is larger Our challenges are great but our will is greater And in our America most generous optimistic nation on face of Earth we must not and will not rest until every man and woman with a dream has means to achieve And today America welcomes into mainstream of life all of our fellow citizens with disabilities We embrace you for your abilities and for your disabilities for our similarities and indeed for our differences for your past courage and your future dreams Last year we celebrated a victory of international freedom Even strongest person couldn't scale Berlin Wall to gain elusive promise of independence that lay just beyond And so together we rejoiced when that barrier fell And now sign legislation which takes a sledgehammer to another wall one which has for too many generations separated Americans with disabilities from freedom they could glimpse but not grasp Once again we rejoice as this barrier falls for claiming together we will not accept we will not excuse we will not tolerate discrimination in America With again great thanks to Members of United States Senate leaders of whom are here today and those who worked so tirelessly for this legislation on both sides of aisles And to those Members of House of Representatives with us here today Democrats and Republicans as well salute you And on your behalf as well as behalf of this entire country now lift my pen to sign this Americans with Disabilities Act and say Let shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down God bless you all\"

salute, members, of, united, states, congress, house, and, senate, who, are, with, us, today, --, active, participants, in, making, this, day, come, true, this, is, indeed, an, incredible, day, --, especially, for, thousands, of, people, across, nation, who, have, given, so, much, of, their, time, their, vision, and, their, courage, to, see, this, act, become, a, reality, you, know, started, trying, to, put, together, a, list, of, all, people, who, should, be, mentioned, today, but, when, list, started, looking, a, little, longer, than, senate, testimony, for, bill, decided, better, give, up, or, that, we'd, never, get, out, of, here, before, sunset, so, even, though, so, many, deserve, cred, will, single, out, but, a, tiny, handful, and, take, those, who, have, guided, me, personally, over, years, of, course, my, friends, evan, kemp, and, justin, dart, up, here, on, platform, with, me;, and, of, course, --, hope, you'll, forgive, me, for, also, saying, a, special, word, of, thanks, to, two, from, white, house, but, again, this, is, personal, so, don't, want, to, offend, those, omitted, --, two, from, white, house, boyden, gray, and, bill, roper, who, labored, long, and, hard, and, want, to, thank, sandy, parrino, of, course, for, her, leadership, and, again, --, is, very, risky, with, all, these, members, of, congress, here, who, worked, so, hard, but, can, say, on, a, very, personal, basis, bob, dole, has, inspired, me, this, is, an, immensely, important, day, a, day, that, belongs, to, all, of, you, everywhere, look, see, people, who, have, dedicated, themselves, to, making, sure, that, this, day, would, come, to, pass, my, friends, from, congress, as, say, who, worked, so, diligently, with, best, interest, of, all, at, heart, democrats, and, republicans;, members, of, this, administration, --, and, i'm, pleased, to, see, so, many, top, officials, and, members, of, my, cabinet, here, today, who, brought, their, caring, and, expertise, to, this, fight;, and, then, organizations, --, so, many, dedicated, organizations, for, people, with, disabilities, who, gave, their, time, and, their, strength;, and, perhaps, most, of, all, everyone, out, there, and, others, --, across, breadth, of, this, nation, are, 43, million, americans, with, disabilities, you, have, made, this, happen, all, of, you, have, made, this, happen, to, all, of, you, just, want, to, say, your, triumph, is, that, your, bill, will, now, be, law, and, that, this, day, belongs, to, you, on, behalf, of, our, nation, very, very, much, three, weeks, ago, we, celebrated, our,

for, disabilities, act, every, man, woman, and, child, with, a, disability, can, now, pass, through, once-closed, doors, into, a, bright, new, era, of, equality, independence, and, freedom, as, look, around, at, all, these, joyous, faces, remember, clearly, how, many, years, of, dedicated, commitment, have, gone, into, making, this, historic, new, civil, rights, act, a, reality, it's, been, work, of, a, true, coalition, a, strong, and, inspiring, coalition, of, people, who, have, shared, both, a, dream, and, a, passionate, determination, to, make, that, dream, come, true, it's, been, a, coalition, in, finest, spir--, a, joining, of, democrats, and, republicans, of, legislative, and, executive, branches, of, federal, and, state, agencies, of, public, officials, and, private, citizens, of, people, with, disabilities, and, without, this, historic, act, is, world's, first, comprehensive, declaration, of, equality, for, people, with, disabilities, --, first, its, passage, has, made,

announced, that, they, hope, to, enact, now, similar, legislation, our, success, with, this, act, proves, that, we, are, keeping, faith, with, spirof, our, courageous, forefathers, who, wrote, in,

\"\", these, words, have, been, our, guide, for, more, than, two, centuries, as, we've, labored, to, form, our, more, perfect, union, but, tragically, for, too, many, americans, blessings, of, liberty, have, been, limited, or, even, denied, the, civil, rights, act, of, '64, took, a, bold, step, towards, righting, that, wrong, but, stark, fact, remained, that, people, with, disabilities, were, still, victims, of, segregation, and, discrimination, and, this, was, intolerable, today's, legislation, brings, us, closer, to, that, day, when, no, americans, will, ever, again, be, deprived, of, their, basic, guarantee, of, life, liberty, and, pursuof, happiness, this, act, is, powerful, in, its, simplicity, it, will, ensure, that, people, with, disabilities, are, given, basic, guarantees, for, which, they, have, worked, so, long, and, so, hard, independence, freedom, of, choice, control, of, their, lives, opportunity, to, blend, fully, and, equally, into, rich, mosaic, of, american, mainstream, legally, will, provide, our, disabled, community, with, a, powerful, expansion, of, protections, and, then, basic, civil, rights, it, will, guarantee, fair, and, just, access, to, fruits, of, american, life, which, we, all, must, be, able, to, enjoy, and, then, specifically, first, ada, ensures, that, employers, covered, by, act, cannot, discriminate, against, qualified, individuals, with, disabilities, second, ada, ensures, access, to, public, accommodations, such, as, restaurants, hotels, shopping, centers, and, offices, and, third, ada, ensures, expanded, access, to, transportation, services, and, fourth, ada, ensures, equivalent, telephone, services, for, people, with, speech, or, hearing, impediments, these, provisions, mean, so, much, to, so, many, to, one, brave, girl, in, particular, they, will, mean, world, lisa, carl, a, young, washington, state, woman, with, cerebral, palsy, who, i'm, told, is, with, us, today, now, will, always, be, admitted, to, her, hometown, theater, lisa, you, might, not, have, been, welcome, at, your, theater, but, i'll, tell, you, --, welcome, to, white, house, we're, glad, you're, here, the, ada, is, a, dramatic, renewal, not, only, for, those, with, disabilities, but, for, all, of, us, because, along, with, precious, privilege, of, being, an, american, comes, a, sacred, duty, to, ensure, that, every, other, american's, rights, are, also, guaranteed, together, we, must, remove, physical, barriers, we, have, created, and, social, barriers, that, we, have, accepted, for, ours, will, never, be, a, truly, prosperous, nation, until, all, within, prosper, for, inspiration, we, need, look, no, further, than, our, own, neighbors, with, us, in, that, wonderful, crowd, out, there, are, people, representing, 18, of, daily, points, of, light, that, i've, named, for, their, extraordinary, involvement, with, disabled, community, we, applaud, you, and, your, shining, example, for, your, leadership, for, all, that, are, here, today, now, let, me, just, tell, you, a, wonderful, story, a, story, about, children, already, working, in, spirof, ada, --, a, story, that, really, touched, me, across, nation, some, 10, 000, youngsters, with, disabilities, are, part, of, little, league's, challenger, division, their, teams, play, just, like, others, but, --, and, this, is, most, remarkable, part, --, as, they, play, at, their, sides, are, volunteer, buddies, from, conventional, little, league, teams, all, of, these, players, work, together, they, team, up, to, wheel, around, bases, and, to, field, grounders, together, and, most, of, all, just, to, play, and, become, friends, we, must, let, these, children, be, our, guides, and, inspiration, also, want, to, say, a, special, word, to, our, friends, in, business, community, you, have, in, your, hands, key, to, success, of, this, act, for, you, can, unlock, a, splendid, resource, of, untapped, human, potential, that, when, freed, will, enrich, us, all, know, there, have, been, concerns, that, ada, may, be, vague, or, costly, or, may, lead, endlessly, to, litigation, but, want, to, reassure, you, right, now, that, my, administration, and, united, states, congress, have, carefully, crafted, this, act, we've, all, been, determined, to, ensure, that, gives, flexibility, particularly, in, terms, of, timetable, of, implementation, and, we've, been, committed, to, containing, costs, that, may, be, incurred, this, act, does, something, important, for, american, business, though, --, and, remember, this, you've, called, for, new, sources, of, workers, well, many, of, our, fellow, citizens, with, disabilities, are, unemployed, they, want, to, work, and, they, can, work, and, this, is, a, tremendous, pool, of, people, and, remember, this, is, a, tremendous, pool, of, people, who, will, bring, to, jobs, diversity, loyalty, proven, low, turnover, rate, and, only, one, request, chance, to, prove, themselves, and, when, you, add, together, federal, state, local, and, private, funds, costs, almost, $200, billion, annually, to, support, americans, with, disabilities, --, in, effect, to, keep, them, dependent, well, when, given, opportunity, to, be, independent, they, will, move, proudly, into, economic, mainstream, of, american, life, and, that's, what, this, legislation, is, all, about, our, problems, are, large, but, our, unified, heart, is, larger, our, challenges, are, great, but, our, will, is, greater, and, in, our, america, most, generous, optimistic, nation, on, face, of, earth, we, must, not, and, will, not, rest, until, every, man, and, woman, with, a, dream, has, means, to, achieve, and, today, america, welcomes, into, mainstream, of, life, all, of, our, fellow, citizens, with, disabilities, we, embrace, you, for, your, abilities, and, for, your, disabilities, for, our, similarities, and, indeed, for, our, differences, for, your, past, courage, and, your, future, dreams, last, year, we, celebrated, a, victory, of, international, freedom, even, strongest, person, couldn't, scale, berlin, wall, to, gain, elusive, promise, of, independence, that, lay, just, beyond, and, so, together, we, rejoiced, when, that, barrier, fell, and, now, sign, legislation, which, takes, a, sledgehammer, to, another, wall, one, which, has, for, too, many, generations, separated, americans, with, disabilities, from, freedom, they, could, glimpse, but, not, grasp, once, again, we, rejoice, as, this, barrier, falls, for, claiming, together, we, will, not, accept, we, will, not, excuse, we, will, not, tolerate, discrimination, in, america, with, again, great, thanks, to, members, of, united, states, senate, leaders, of, whom, are, here, today, and, those, who, worked, so,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |In life of a nation we're called upon to define who we are and what we believe Sometimes these choices are not easy But today as ask for your support in a decision I've made to stand up for what's right and condemn what's wrong all in cause of peace At my direction elements of 82d Airborne Division as well as key units of United States Air Force are arriving today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia took this action to assist Saudi Arabian Government in defense of its homeland No one commits America's Armed Forces to a dangerous mission lightly but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation and exhausting every alternative became necessary to take this action Let me tell you why Less than a week ago in early morning hours of August 2d Iraqi Armed Forces without provocation or warning invaded a peaceful Kuwa Facing negligible resistance from its much smaller neighbor Iraq's tanks stormed in blitzkrieg fashion through Kuwain a few short hours With more than 100 000 troops along with tanks artillery and surface-to-surface missiles Iraq now occupies Kuwa This aggression came just hours after Saddam Hussein specifically assured numerous countries in area that there would be no invasion There is no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and brutal act of aggression A puppet regime imposed from outside is unacceptable The acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable No one friend or foe should doubt our desire for peace; and no one should underestimate our determination to confront aggression Four simple principles guide our policy First we seek immediate unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwa Second Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored to replace puppet regime And third my administration as has been case with every from Roosevelt to Reagan is committed to security and stability of Persian Gulf And fourth am determined to protect lives of American citizens abroad Immediately after Iraqi invasion ordered an embargo of all trade with Iraq and together with many other nations announced sanctions that both freeze all Iraqi assets in this country and protected Kuwait's assets The stakes are high Iraq is already a rich and powerful country that possesses world's second largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms It's fourth largest military in world Our country now imports nearly half oil consumes and could face a major threat to its economic independence Much of world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more vulnerable to Iraqi threats We succeeded in struggle for freedom in Europe because we and our allies remain stalwart Keeping peace in Middle East will require no less We're beginning a new era This new era can be full of promise an age of freedom a time of peace for all peoples But if history teaches us anything is that we must resist aggression or will destroy our freedoms Appeasement does not work As was case in 1930's we see in Saddam Hussein an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors Only 14 days ago Saddam Hussein promised his friends he would not invade Kuwa And 4 days ago he promised world he would withdraw And twice we have seen what his promises mean His promises mean nothing In last few days I've spoken with political leaders from Middle East Europe Asia and Americas; and I've met with Prime Minister Thatcher Prime Minister Mulroney and NATO Secretary General Woerner And all agree that Iraq cannot be allowed to beneffrom its invasion of Kuwa We agree that this is not an American problem or a European problem or a Middle East problem It is world's problem And that's why soon after Iraqi invasion United Nations Security Council without dissent condemned Iraq calling for immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troops from Kuwa The Arab world through both Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council courageously announced its opposition to Iraqi aggression Japan United Kingdom and France and other governments around world have imposed severe sanctions The Soviet Union and China ended all arms sales to Iraq And this past Monday United Nations Security Council approved for first time in 23 years mandatory sanctions under chapter VI of United Nations Charter These sanctions now enshrined in international law have potential to deny Iraq fruits of aggression while sharply limiting its ability to either import or export anything of value especially oil pledge here today that United States will do its part to see that these sanctions are effective and to induce Iraq to withdraw without delay from Kuwa But we must recognize that Iraq may not stop using force to advance its ambitions Iraq has massed an enormous war machine on Saudi border capable of initiating hostilities with little or no additional preparation Given Iraqi government's history of aggression against its own citizens as well as its neighbors to assume Iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic And therefore after consulting with King Fahd sent Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to discuss cooperative measures we could take Following those meetings Saudi Government requested our help and responded to that request by ordering U S air and ground forces to deploy to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Let me be clear The sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital interest to United States This decision which shared with congressional leadership grows out of longstanding friendship and security relationship between United States and Saudi Arabia U S forces will work together with those of Saudi Arabia and other nations to preserve integrity of Saudi Arabia and to deter further Iraqi aggression Through their presence as well as through training and exercises these multinational forces will enhance overall capability of Saudi Armed Forces to defend Kingdom want to be clear about what we are doing and why America does not seek conflict nor do we seek to chart destiny of other nations But America will stand by her friends The mission of our troops is wholly defensive Hopefully they will not be needed long They will not initiate hostilities but they will defend themselves Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other friends in Persian Gulf We are working around clock to deter Iraqi aggression and to enforce U N sanctions I'm continuing my conversations with world leaders Secretary of Defense Cheney has just returned from valuable consultations with Mubarak of Egypt and King Hassan of Morocco Secretary of State Baker has consulted with his counterparts in many nations including Soviet Union and today he heads for Europe to consult with Ozal of Turkey a staunch friend of United States And he'll then consult with NATO Foreign Ministers will ask oil-producing nations to do what they can to increase production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reductions will have on world economy And will explore whether we and our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves Conservation measures can also help; Americans everywhere must do their part And one more thing I'm asking oil companies to do their fair share They should show restraint and not abuse today's uncertainties to raise prices Standing up for our principles will not come easy It may take time and possibly cost a great deal But we are asking no more of anyone than of brave young men and women of our Armed Forces and their families And ask that in churches around country prayers be said for those who are committed to protect and defend America's interests Standing up for our principle is an American tradition As has so many times before may take time and tremendous effort but most of all will take unity of purpose As I've witnessed throughout my life in both war and peace America has never wavered when her purpose is driven by principle And in this August day at home and abroad know she will do no less and God bless

your, support, in, a, decision, i've, made, to, stand, up, for, what's, right, and, condemn, what's, wrong, all, in, cause, of, peace, at, my, direction, elements, of, 82d, airborne, division, as, well, as, key, units, of, united, states, air, force, are, arriving, today, to, take, up, defensive, positions, in, saudi, arabia, took, this, action, to, assist, saudi, arabian, government, in, defense, of, its, homeland, no, one, commits, america's, armed, forces, to, a, dangerous, mission, lightly, but, after, perhaps, unparalleled, international, consultation, and, exhausting, every, alternative, became, necessary, to, take, this, action, let, me, tell, you, why, less, than, a, week, ago, in, early, morning, hours, of, august, 2d, iraqi, armed, forces, without, provocation, or, warning, invaded, a, peaceful, kuwa, facing, negligible, resistance, from, its, much, smaller, neighbor, iraq's, tanks, stormed, in, blitzkrieg, fashion, through, kuwain, a, few, short, hours, with, more, than, 100, 000, troops, along, with, tanks, artillery, and, surface-to-surface, missiles, iraq, now, occupies, kuwa, this, aggression, came, just, hours, after, saddam, hussein, specifically, assured, numerous, countries, in, area, that, there, would, be, no, invasion, there, is, no, justification, whatsoever, for, this, outrageous, and, brutal, act, of, aggression, a, puppet, regime, imposed, from, outside, is, unacceptable, the, acquisition, of, territory, by, force, is, unacceptable, no, one, friend, or, foe, should, doubt, our, desire, for, peace;, and, no, one, should, underestimate, our, determination, to, confront, aggression, four, simple, principles, guide, our, policy, first, we, seek, immediate, unconditional, and, complete, withdrawal, of, all, iraqi, forces, from, kuwa, second, kuwait's, legitimate, government, must, be, restored, to, replace, puppet, regime, and, third, my, administration, as, has, been, case, with, every, from, roosevelt, to, reagan, is, committed, to, security, and, stability, of, persian, gulf, and, fourth, am, determined, to, protect, lives, of, american, citizens, abroad, immediately, after, iraqi, invasion, ordered, an, embargo, of, all, trade, with, iraq, and, together, with, many, other, nations, announced, sanctions, that, both, freeze, all, iraqi, assets, in, this, country, and, protected, kuwait's, assets, the, stakes, are, high, iraq, is, already, a, rich, and, powerful, country, that, possesses, world's, second, largest, reserves, of, oil, and, over, a, million, men, under, arms, it's, fourth, largest, military, in, world, our, country, now, imports, nearly, half, oil, consumes, and, could, face, a, major, threat, to, its, economic, independence, much, of, world, is, even, more, dependent, upon, imported, oil, and, is, even, more, vulnerable, to, iraqi, threats, we, succeeded, in, struggle, for, freedom, in, europe, because, we, and, our, allies, remain, stalwart, keeping, peace, in, middle, east, will, require, no, less, we're, beginning, a, new, era, this, new, era, can, be, full, of, promise, an, age, of, freedom, a, time, of, peace, for, all, peoples, but, if, history, teaches, us, anything, is, that, we, must, resist, aggression, or, will, destroy, our, freedoms, appeasement, does, not, work, as, was, case, in, 1930's, we, see, in, saddam, hussein, an, aggressive, dictator, threatening, his, neighbors, only, 14, days, ago, saddam, hussein, promised, his, friends, he, would, not, invade, kuwa, and, 4, days, ago, he, promised, world, he, would, withdraw, and, twice, we, have, seen, what, his, promises, mean, his, promises, mean, nothing, in, last, few, days, i've, spoken, with, political, leaders, from, middle, east, europe, asia, and, americas;, and, i've, met, with, prime, minister, thatcher, prime, minister, mulroney, and, nato, secretary, general, woerner, and, all, agree, that, iraq, cannot, be, allowed, to, beneffrom, its, invasion, of, kuwa, we, agree, that, this, is, not, an, american, problem, or, a, european, problem, or, a, middle, east, problem, it, is, world's, problem, and, that's, why, soon, after, iraqi, invasion, united, nations, security, council, without, dissent, condemned, iraq, calling, for, immediate, and, unconditional, withdrawal, of, its, troops, from, kuwa, the, arab, world, through, both, arab, league, and, gulf, cooperation, council, courageously, announced, its, opposition, to, iraqi, aggression, japan, united, kingdom, and, france, and, other, governments, around, world, have, imposed, severe, sanctions, the, soviet, union, and, china, ended, all, arms, sales, to, iraq, and, this, past, monday, united, nations, security, council, approved, for, first, time, in, 23, years, mandatory, sanctions, under, chapter, vi, of, united, nations, charter, these, sanctions, now, enshrined, in, international, law, have, potential, to, deny, iraq, fruits, of, aggression, while, sharply, limiting, its, ability, to, either, import, or, export, anything, of, value, especially, oil, pledge, here, today, that, united, states, will, do, its, part, to, see, that, these, sanctions, are, effective, and, to, induce, iraq, to, withdraw, without, delay, from, kuwa, but, we, must, recognize, that, iraq, may, not, stop, using, force, to, advance, its, ambitions, iraq, has, massed, an, enormous, war, machine, on, saudi, border, capable, of, initiating, hostilities, with, little, or, no, additional, preparation, given, iraqi, government's, history, of, aggression, against, its, own, citizens, as, well, as, its, neighbors, to, assume, iraq, will, not, attack, again, would, be, unwise, and, unrealistic, and, therefore, after, consulting, with, king, fahd, sent, secretary, of, defense, dick, cheney, to, discuss, cooperative, measures, we, could, take, following, those, meetings, saudi, government, requested, our, help, and, responded, to, that, request, by, ordering, u, s, air, and, ground, forces, to, deploy, to, kingdom, of, saudi, arabia, let, me, be, clear, the, sovereign, independence, of, saudi, arabia, is, of, vital, interest, to, united, states, this, decision, which, shared, with, congressional, leadership, grows, out, of, longstanding, friendship, and, security, relationship, between, united, states, and, saudi, arabia, u, s, forces, will, work, together, with, those, of, saudi, arabia, and, other, nations, to, preserve, integrity, of, saudi, arabia, and, to, deter, further, iraqi, aggression, through, their, presence, as, well, as, through, training, and, exercises, these, multinational, forces, will, enhance, overall, capability, of, saudi, armed, forces, to, defend, kingdom, want, to, be, clear, about, what, we, are, doing, and, why, america, does, not, seek, conflict, nor, do, we,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"and and Members of United States Congress distinguished guests fellow Americans very much for that warm welcome We gather tonight witness to events in Persian Gulf as significant as they are tragic In early morning hours of August 2d following negotiations and promises by Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein not to use force a powerful Iraqi army invaded its trusting and much weaker neighbor Kuwa Within 3 days 120 000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwaand moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia It was then that decided to act to check that aggression At this moment our brave servicemen and women stand watch in that distant desert and on distant seas side by side with forces of more than 20 other nations They are some of finest men and women of United States of America And they're doing one terrific job These valiant Americans were ready at a moment's notice to leave their spouses and their children to serve on front line halfway around world They remind us who keeps America strong they do In trying circumstances of Gulf morale of our service men and women is excellent In face of danger they're brave they're well-trained and dedicated A soldier Private First Class Wade Merritt of Knoxville Tennessee now stationed in Saudi Arabia wrote his parents of his worries his love of family and his hope for peace But Wade also wrote \"\" am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane aggression am proud of my army and its men am proud to serve my country \"\" Well let me just say Wade America is proud of you and is grateful to every soldier sailor marine and airman serving cause of peace in Persian Gulf also want to thank Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff General Powell; Chiefs here tonight; our commander in Persian Gulf General Schwartzkopf; and men and women of Department of Defense What a magnificent job you all are doing And very very much from a grateful people wish could say that their work is done But we all know it's not So if there ever was a time to put country before self and patriotism before party time is now And let me thank all Americans especially those here in this Chamber tonight for your support for our armed forces and for their mission That support will be even more important in days to come So tonight want to talk to you about what's at stake -- what we must do together to defend civilized values around world and maintain our economic strength at home Our objectives in Persian Gulf are clear our goals defined and familiar Iraq must withdraw from Kuwacompletely immediately and without condition Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored The security and stability of Persian Gulf must be assured And American citizens abroad must be protected These goals are not ours alone They've been endorsed by United Nations Security Council five times in as many weeks Most countries share our concern for principle And many have a stake in stability of Persian Gulf This is not as Saddam Hussein would have United States against Iraq It is Iraq against world As you know I've just returned from a very productive meeting with Soviet Gorbachev And am pleased that we are working together to build a new relationship In Helsinki our joint statement affirmed to world our shared resolve to counter Iraq's threat to peace Let me quote \"\"We are united in belief that Iraq's aggression must not be tolerated No peaceful international order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors \"\" Clearly no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression A new partnership of nations has begun We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment The crisis in Persian Gulf as grave as is also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation Out of these troubled times our fifth objective -- a new world order -- can emerge a new era -- freer from threat of terror stronger in pursuof justice and more secure in quest for peace An era in which nations of world East and West North and South can prosper and live in harmony A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across span of human endeavor Today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from one we've known A world where rule of law supplants rule of jungle A world in which nations recognize shared responsibility for freedom and justice A world where strong respect rights of weak This is vision that shared with Gorbachev in Helsinki He and other leaders from Europe Gulf and around world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape future for generations to come The test we face is great and so are stakes This is first assault on new world that we seek first test of our mettle Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination would be a signal to actual and potential despots around world America and world must defend common vital interests -- and we will America and world must support rule of law -- and we will America and world must stand up to aggression -- and we will And one thing more In pursuof these goals America will not be intimidated Vital issues of principle are at stake Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off face of Earth We do not exaggerate Nor do we exaggerate when we say Saddam Hussein will fail Vital economic interests are at risk as well Iraq itself controls some 10 percent of world's proven oil reserves Iraq plus Kuwacontrols twice that An Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwawould have economic and military power as well as arrogance to intimidate and coerce its neighbors -- neighbors who control lion's share of world's remaining oil reserves We cannot perma resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless And we won't Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American leadership In face of tyranny let no one doubt American credibility and reliability Let no one doubt our staying power We will stand by our friends One way or another leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth From outset acting hand in hand with others we've sought to fashion broadest possible international response to Iraq's aggression The level of world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at request of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and if need be to defend against attack Moslems and non-Moslems Arabs and non-Arabs soldiers from many nations stand shoulder to shoulder resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions We can now point to five United Nations Security Council resolutions that condemn Iraq's aggression They call for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government and categorically reject Iraq's cynical and self-serving attempt to annex Kuwa Finally United Nations has demanded release of all foreign nationals held hostage against their will and in contravention of international law It is a mockery of human decency to call these people \"\"guests \"\" They are hostages and whole world knows Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher a dependable ally said all \"\"We do not bargain over hostages We will not stoop to level of using human beings as bargaining chips ever \"\" Of course of course our hearts go out to hostages and to their families But our policy cannot change and will not change America and world will not be blackmailed by this ruthless policy We're now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders We owe much to outstanding leadership of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar The United Nations is backing up its words with action The Security Council has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq designed to force Iraq to relinquish spoils of its illegal conquest The Security Council has also taken decisive step of authorizing use of all means necessary to ensure compliance with these sanctions Together with our friends and allies ships of United States Navy are today patrolling Mideast waters They've already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce sanctions Three regional leaders spoke with just yesterday told me that these sanctions are working Iraq is feeling heat We continue to hope that Iraq's leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them They are cut off from world trade unable to sell their oil And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through The communique with Gorbachev made mention of what happens when embargo is so effective that children of Iraq literally need milk or sick truly need medicine Then under strict international supervision that guarantees proper destination then food will be permitted At home material cost of our leadership can be steep That's why Secretary of State Baker and Treasury Secretary Brady have met with many world leaders to underscore that burden of this collective effort must be shared We are prepared to do our share and more to help carry that load; we insist that others do their share as well The response of most of our friends and allies has been good To help defray costs leaders of Saudi Arabia Kuwa and UAE -- United Arab Emirates -- have pledged to provide our deployed troops with all food and fuel they need Generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front-line nations such as Turkey and Egypt am also heartened to report that this international response extends to neediest victims of this conflict -- those refugees For our part we've contributed $28 million for relief efforts This is but a portion of what is needed commend in particular Saudi Arabia Japan and several European nations who have joined us in this purely humanitarian effort There's an energy-related cost to be borne as well Oil-producing nations are already replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output More than half of what was lost has been made up And we're getting superb cooperation If producers including United States continue steps to expand oil and gas production we can stabilize prices and guarantee against hardship Additionally we and several of our allies always have option to extract oil from our strategic petroleum reserves if conditions warrant As I've pointed out before conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible And we must then take advantage of our energy sources across board coal natural gas hydro and nuclear Our failure to do these things has made us more dependent on foreign oil than ever before Finally let no one even contemplate profiteering from this crisis We will not have cannot predict just how long will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwa Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect We will continue to review all options with our allies but let be clear we will not let this aggression stand Our interest our involvement in Gulf is not transitory It predated Saddam Hussein's aggression and will survive Long after all our troops come home -- and we all hope it's soon very soon -- there will be a lasting role for United States in assisting nations of Persian Gulf Our role then to deter future aggression Our role is to help our friends in their own self-defense And something else to curb proliferation of chemical biological ballistic missile and above all nuclear technologies Let me also make clear that United States has no quarrel with Iraqi people Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwa That's not a threat that's not a boast that's just way it's going to be Our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we conduct ourselves at home Our economy our Armed Forces our energy dependence and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and stand up to our foes For America to lead America must remain strong and vital Our world leadership and domestic strength are mutual and reinforcing; a woven piece strongly bound as Old Glory To revitalize our leadership our leadership capacity we must address our budget defic-- not after election day or next year but now Higher oil prices slow our growth and higher defense costs would only make our fiscal deficproblem worse That deficwas already greater than should have been -- a projected $232 billion for coming year It must -- will -- be reduced To my friends in Congress together we must act this very month -- before next fiscal year begins on October 1st -- to get America's economic house in order The Gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than we ever should be Americans must never again enter any crisis economic or military with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive burden of Federal debt Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in Congress and between branches over budget matters It is high time we pulled together and get job done right It's up to us to straighten this out This job has four basic parts First Congress should this month within a budget agreement enact growth-oriented tax measures -- to help avoid recession in short term and to increase savings investment productivity and competitiveness for longer term These measures include extending incentives for research and experimentation; expanding use of IRA's for new homeowners; establishing tax-deferred family savings accounts; creating incentives for creation of enterprise zones and initiatives to encourage more domestic drilling; and yes reducing tax rate on capital gains And second Congress should this month enact a prudent multiyear defense program one that reflects not only improvement in East-West relations but our broader responsibilities to deal with continuing risks of outlaw action and regional conflict Even with our obligations in Gulf a sound defense budget can have some reduction in real terms; and we're prepared to accept that But to go beyond such levels where cutting defense would threaten our vital margin of safety is something will never accept The world is still dangerous And surely that is now clear Stability's not secure American interests are far reaching Interdependence has increased The consequences of regional instability can be global This is no time to risk America's capacity to protect her vital interests And third Congress should this month enact measures to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil These measures should include my proposals to increase incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration fuel-switching and to accelerate development of Alaskan energy resources without damage to wildlife As you know when oil embargo was imposed in early 1970's United States imported almost 6 million barrels of oil a day This year before Iraqi invasion U S imports had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day And we'd moved in wrong direction And now we must act to correct that trend And fourth Congress should this month enact a 5-year program to reduce projected debt and deficits by $500 billion -- that's by half a trillion dollars And if with Congress we can develop a satisfactory program by end of month we can avoid ax of sequester -- deep across-the-board cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption want to be able to tell American people that we have truly solved deficproblem And for me to do that a budget agreement must meet these tests It must include measures I've recommended to increase economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil It must be fair All should contribute but burden should not be excessive for any one group of programs or people It must address growth of government's hidden liabilities It must reform budget process and further must be real urge Congress to provide a comprehensive 5-year deficreduction program to me as a complete legislative package with measures to assure that can be fully enforced America is tired of phony deficreduction or promise-now save-later plans It is time for a program that is credible and real And finally to extent that deficreduction program includes new revenue measures must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn us back toward days of punishing income tax rates That is one path we should not head down again have been pleased with recent progress although has not always seemed so smooth But now it's time to produce hope we can work out a responsible plan But with or without agreement from budget summ ask both Houses of Congress to allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500-billion deficreduction package not later than September 28 If Congress cannot get me a budget then Americans will have to face a tough mandated sequester I'm hopeful in fact I'm confident that Congress will do what should And can assure you that we in executive branch will do our part In final analysis our ability to meet our responsibilities abroad depends upon political will and consensus at home This is never easy in democracies for we govern only with consent of governed And although free people in a free society are bound to have their differences Americans traditionally come together in times of adversity and challenge Once again Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful goodbye with their families before leaving for a strange and distant shore At this very moment they serve together with Arabs Europeans Asians and Africans in defense of principle and dream of a new world order That's why they sweat and toil in sand and heat and sun If they can come together under such adversity if old adversaries like Soviet Union and United States can work in common cause then surely we who are so fortunate to be in this great Chamber -- Democrats Republicans liberals conservatives -- can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here Good night And God bless United States of

countries, share, our, concern, for, principle, and, many, have, a, stake, in, stability, of, persian, gulf, this, is, not, as, saddam, hussein, would, have, united, states, against, iraq, it, is, iraq, against, world, as, you, know, i've, just, returned, from, a, very, productive, meeting, with, soviet, gorbachev, and, am, pleased, that, we, are, working, together, to, build, a, new, relationship, in, helsinki, our, joint, statement, affirmed, to, world, our, shared, resolve, to, counter, iraq's, threat, to, peace, let, me, quote, \"\"we, are, united, in, belief, that, iraq's,

moment, the, crisis, in, persian, gulf, as, grave, as, is, also, offers, a, rare, opportunity, to, move, toward, an, historic, period, of, cooperation, out, of, these, troubled, times, our, fifth, objective, --, a, new, world, order, --, can, emerge, a, new, era, --, freer, from, threat, of, terror, stronger, in, pursuof, justice, and, more, secure, in, quest, for, peace, an, era, in, which, nations, of, world, east, and, west, north, and, south, can, prosper, and, live, in, harmony, a, hundred, generations, have, searched, for, this, elusive, path, to, peace, while, a, thousand, wars, raged, across, span, of, human, endeavor, today, that, new, world, is, struggling, to, be, born, a, world, quite, different, from, one, we've, known, a, world, where, rule, of, law, supplants, rule, of, jungle, a, world, in, which, nations, recognize, shared, responsibility, for, freedom, and, justice, a, world, where, strong, respect, rights, of, weak, this, is, vision, that, shared, with, gorbachev, in, helsinki, he, and, other, leaders, from, europe, gulf, and, around, world, understand, that, how, we, manage, this, crisis, today, could, shape, future, for, generations, to, come, the, test, we, face, is, great, and, so, are, stakes, this, is, first, assault, on, new, world, that, we, seek, first, test, of, our, mettle, had, we, not, responded, to, this, first, provocation, with, clarity, of, purpose, if, we, do, not, continue, to, demonstrate, our, determination, would, be, a, signal, to, actual, and, potential, despots, around, world, america, and, world, must, defend, common, vital, interests, --, and, we, will, america, and, world, must, support, rule, of, law, --, and, we, will, america, and, world, must, stand, up, to, aggression, --, and, we, will, and, one, thing, more, in, pursuof, these, goals, america, will, not, be, intimidated, vital, issues, of, principle, are, at, stake, saddam, hussein, is, literally, trying, to, wipe, a, country, off, face, of, earth, we, do, not, exaggerate, nor, do, we, exaggerate, when, we, say, saddam, hussein, will, fail, vital, economic, interests, are, at, risk, as, well, iraq, itself, controls, some, 10, percent, of, world's, proven, oil, reserves, iraq, plus, kuwacontrols, twice, that, an, iraq, permitted, to, swallow, kuwawould, have, economic, and, military, power, as, well, as, arrogance, to, intimidate, and, coerce, its, neighbors, --, neighbors, who, control, lion's, share, of, world's, remaining, oil, reserves, we, cannot, perma, resource, so, vital, to, be, dominated, by, one, so, ruthless, and, we, won't, recent, events, have, surely, proven, that, there, is, no, substitute, for, american, leadership, in, face, of, tyranny, let, no, one, doubt, american, credibility, and, reliability, let, no, one, doubt, our, staying, power, we, will, stand, by, our, friends, one, way, or, another, leader, of, iraq, must, learn, this, fundamental, truth, from, outset, acting, hand, in, hand, with, others, we've, sought, to, fashion, broadest, possible, international, response, to, iraq's, aggression, the, level, of, world, cooperation, and, condemnation, of, iraq, is, unprecedented, armed, forces, from, countries, spanning, four, continents, are, there, at, request, of, king, fahd, of, saudi, arabia, to, deter, and, if, need, be, to, defend, against, attack, moslems, and, non-moslems, arabs, and, non-arabs, soldiers, from, many, nations, stand, shoulder, to, shoulder, resolute, against, saddam, hussein's, ambitions, we, can, now, point, to, five, united, nations, security, council, resolutions, that, condemn, iraq's, aggression, they, call, for, iraq's, immediate, and, unconditional, withdrawal, restoration, of, kuwait's, legitimate, government, and, categorically, reject, iraq's, cynical, and, self-serving, attempt, to, annex, kuwa, finally, united, nations, has, demanded, release, of, all, foreign, nationals, held, hostage, against, their, will, and, in, contravention, of, international, law, it, is, a, mockery, of, human, decency, to, call, these, people, \"\"guests, \"\", they, are, hostages, and, whole, world, knows, prime, minister, margaret,

policy, we're, now, in, sight, of, a, united, nations, that, performs, as, envisioned, by, its, founders, we, owe, much, to, outstanding, leadership, of, secretary-general, javier, perez, de, cuellar, the, united, nations, is, backing, up, its, words, with, action, the, security, council, has, imposed, mandatory, economic, sanctions, on, iraq, designed, to, force, iraq, to, relinquish, spoils, of, its, illegal, conquest, the, security, council, has, also, taken, decisive, step, of, authorizing, use, of, all, means, necessary, to, ensure, compliance, with, these, sanctions, together, with, our, friends, and, allies, ships, of, united, states, navy, are, today, patrolling, mideast, waters, they've, already, intercepted, more, than, 700, ships, to, enforce, sanctions, three, regional, leaders, spoke, with, just, yesterday, told, me, that, these, sanctions, are, working, iraq, is, feeling, heat, we, continue, to, hope, that, iraq's, leaders, will, recalculate, just, what, their, aggression, has, cost, them, they, are, cut, off, from, world, trade, unable, to, sell, their, oil, and, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, goods, gets, through, the, communique, with, gorbachev, made, mention, of, what, happens, when, embargo, is, so, effective, that, children, of, iraq, literally, need, milk, or, sick, truly, need, medicine, then, under, strict, international, supervision, that, guarantees, proper, destination, then, food, will, be, permitted, at, home, material, cost, of, our, leadership, can, be, steep, that's, why, secretary, of, state, baker, and, treasury, secretary, brady, have, met, with, many, world, leaders, to, underscore, that, burden, of, this, collective, effort, must, be, shared, we, are, prepared, to, do, our, share, and, more, to, help, carry, that, load;, we, insist, that, others, do, their, share, as, well, the, response, of, most, of, our, friends, and, allies, has, been, good, to, help, defray, costs, leaders, of, saudi, arabia, kuwa, and, uae, --, united, arab, emirates, --, have, pledged, to, provide, our, deployed, troops, with, all, food, and, fuel, they, need, generous, assistance, will, also, be, provided, to, stalwart, front-line, nations, such, as, turkey, and, egypt, am, also, heartened, to, report, that, this, international, response, extends, to, neediest, victims, of, this, conflict, --, those, refugees, for, our, part, we've, contributed, $28, million, for, relief, efforts, this, is, but, a, portion, of, what, is, needed, commend, in, particular, saudi, arabia, japan, and, several, european, nations, who, have, joined, us, in, this, purely, humanitarian, effort, there's, an, energy-related, cost, to, be, borne, as, well, oil-producing, nations, are, already, replacing, lost, iraqi, and, kuwaiti, output, more, than, half, of, what, was, lost, has, been, made, up, and, we're, getting, superb, cooperation, if, producers, including, united, states, continue, steps, to, expand, oil, and, gas, production, we, can, stabilize, prices, and, guarantee, against, hardship, additionally, we, and, several, of, our, allies, always, have, option, to, extract, oil, from, our, strategic, petroleum, reserves, if, conditions, warrant, as, i've, pointed, out, before, conservation, efforts, are, essential, to, keep, our, energy, needs, as, low, as, possible, and, we, must, then, take, advantage, of, our, energy, sources, across, board, coal, natural, gas, hydro, and, nuclear, our, failure, to, do, these, things, has, made, us, more, dependent, on, foreign, oil, than, ever, before, finally, let, no, one, even, contemplate, profiteering, from, this, crisis, we, will, not, have, cannot, predict, just, how, long, will, take, to, convince, iraq, to, withdraw, from, kuwa, sanctions, will, take, time, to, have, their, full, intended, effect, we, will, continue, to, review, all, options, with, our, allies, but, let, be, clear, we, will, not, let, this, aggression, stand, our, interest, our, involvement, in, gulf, is, not, transitory, it, predated, saddam, hussein's, aggression, and, will, survive, long, after, all, our, troops, come, home, --, and, we, all, hope, it's, soon, very, soon, --, there, will, be, a, lasting, role, for, united, states, in, assisting, nations, of, persian, gulf, our, role, then, to, deter, future, aggression, our, role, is, to, help, our, friends, in, their, own, self-defense, and, something, else, to, curb, proliferation, of, chemical, biological, ballistic, missile, and, above, all, nuclear, technologies, let, me, also, make, clear, that, united, states, has, no, quarrel, with, iraqi, people, our, quarrel, is, with, iraq's, dictator, and, with, his, aggression, iraq, will, not, be, permitted, to, annex, kuwa, that's, not, a, threat, that's, not, a, boast, that's, just, way, it's, going, to, be, our, ability, to, function, effectively, as, a, great, power, abroad, depends, on, how, we, conduct, ourselves, at, home, our, economy, our, armed, forces, our, energy, dependence, and, our, cohesion, all, determine, whether, we, can, help, our, friends, and, stand, up, to, our, foes, for, america, to, lead, america, must, remain, strong, and, vital, our, world, leadership, and, domestic, strength, are, mutual, and, reinforcing;, a, woven, piece, strongly, bound, as, old, glory, to, revitalize, our, leadership, our, leadership, capacity, we, must, address, our, budget, defic--, not, after, election, day, or, next, year, but, now, higher, oil, prices, slow, our, growth, and, higher, defense, costs, would, only, make, our, fiscal, deficproblem, worse, that, deficwas, already, greater, than, should, have, been, --, a, projected, $232, billion, for, coming, year, it, must, --, will, --, be, reduced, to, my, friends, in, congress, together, we, must, act, this, very, month, --, before, next, fiscal, year, begins, on, october, 1st, --, to, get, america's, economic, house, in, order, the, gulf, situation, helps, us, realize, we, are, more, economically, vulnerable, than, we, ever, should, be, americans, must, never, again, enter, any, crisis, economic, or, military, with, an, excessive, dependence, on, foreign, oil, and, an, excessive, burden, of, federal, debt, most, americans, are, sick, and, tired, of, endless, battles, in, congress, and, between, branches, over, budget, matters, it, is, high, time, we, pulled, together, and, get, job, done, right, it's, up, to, us, to, straighten, this, out, this, job, has, four, basic, parts, first, congress, should, this, month, within, a, budget, agreement, enact, growth-oriented, tax, measures, --, to, help, avoid, recession, in, short, term, and, to, increase, savings, investment, productivity, and, competitiveness, for, longer, term, these, measures, include, extending, incentives, for, research, and, experimentation;, expanding, use, of, ira's, for, new, homeowners;, establishing, tax-deferred, family, savings, accounts;, creating, incentives, for, creation, of, enterprise, zones, and, initiatives, to, encourage, more, domestic, drilling;, and, yes, reducing, tax, rate, on, capital, gains, and, second, congress, should, this, month, enact, a, prudent, multiyear, defense, program, one, that, reflects, not, only, improvement, in, east-west, relations, but, our, broader, responsibilities, to, deal, with, continuing, risks, of, outlaw, action, and, regional, conflict, even, with, our, obligations, in, gulf, a, sound, defense, budget, can, have, some, reduction, in, real, terms;, and, we're, prepared, to, accept, that, but, to, go, beyond, such, levels, where, cutting, defense, would, threaten, our, vital, margin, of, safety, is, something, will, never, accept, the, world, is, still, dangerous, and, surely, that, is, now, clear, stability's, not, secure, american, interests, are, far, reaching, interdependence, has, increased, the, consequences, of, regional, instability, can, be, global, this, is, no, time, to, risk, america's, capacity, to, protect, her, vital, interests, and, third, congress, should, this, month, enact, measures, to, increase, domestic, energy, production, and, energy, conservation, in, order, to, reduce, dependence, on, foreign, oil, these, measures, should, include, my, proposals, to, increase, incentives, for, domestic, oil, and, gas, exploration, fuel-switching, and, to, accelerate, development, of, alaskan, energy, resources, without, damage, to, wildlife, as, you, know, when, oil, embargo, was, imposed, in, early, 1970's, united, states, imported, almost, 6, million, barrels, of, oil, a, day, this, year, before, iraqi, invasion, u, s, imports, had, risen, to, nearly, 8, million, barrels, per, day, and, we'd, moved, in, wrong, direction, and, now, we, must, act, to, correct, that, trend, and, fourth, congress, should, this, month, enact, a, 5-year, program, to, reduce, projected, debt, and, deficits, by, $500, billion, --, that's, by, half, a, trillion, dollars, and, if, with, congress, we, can, develop, a, satisfactory, program, by, end, of, month, we, can, avoid, ax, of, sequester, --, deep, across-the-board, cuts, that, would, threaten, our, military, capacity, and, risk, substantial, domestic, disruption, want, to, be, able, to, tell, american, people, that, we, have, truly, solved, deficproblem, and, for, me, to, do, that, a, budget, agreement, must, meet, these, tests, it, must, include, measures, i've, recommended, to, increase, economic, growth, and, reduce, dependence, on, foreign, oil, it, must, be, fair, all, should, contribute, but, burden, should, not, be, excessive, for, any, one, group, of, programs, or, people, it, must, address, growth, of, government's, hidden, liabilities, it, must, reform, budget, process, and, further, must, be, real, urge, congress, to, provide, a, comprehensive, 5-year, deficreduction, program, to, me, as, a, complete, legislative, package, with, measures, to, assure, that, can, be, fully, enforced, america, is, tired, of, phony, deficreduction, or, promise-now, save-later, plans, it, is, time, for, a, program, that, is, credible, and, real, and, finally, to, extent, that,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |very much Secretary-General distinguished delegates to United Nations is really a great privilege to greet you today as we begin what marks a new and historic session of General Assembly My congratulations to Honorable Guido De Marco on your election sir as of General Assembly And on a personal note want to say that having witnessed unprecedented unity and cooperation of past 2 months that have never been prouder to have once served within your ranks and never been prouder that United States is host country for United Nations Forty-five years ago while fires of an epic war still raged across two oceans and two continents a small group of men and women began a search for hope amid ruins And they gathered in San Francisco stepping back from haze and horror to try to shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream Intensely idealistic and yet tempered by war they sought to build a new kind of bridge a bridge between nations a bridge that might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest day The founding of United Nations embodied our deepest hopes for a peaceful world and during past year we've come closer than ever before to realizing those hopes We've seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom The Revolution of '89 swept world almost with a life of its own carried by a new breeze of freedom It transformed political climate from Central Europe to Central America and touched almost every corner of globe That breeze has been sustained by a now almost universal recognition of a simple fundamental truth The human spircannot be locked up forever The truth is people everywhere are motivated in much same ways And people everywhere want much same things chance to live a life of purpose; chance to choose a life in which they and their children can learn and grow healthy worship freely and prosper through work of their hands and their hearts and their minds We're not talking about power of nations but power of individuals power to choose power to risk power to succeed This is a new and different world Not since 1945 have we seen real possibility of using United Nations as was designed as a center for international collective security The changes in Soviet Union have been critical to emergence of a stronger United Nations The U S -Soviet relationship is finally beyond containment and confrontation and now we seek to fulfill promise of mutually shared understanding The long twilight struggle that for 45 years has divided Europe our two nations and much of world has come to an end Much has changed over last 2 years The Soviet Union has taken many dramatic and important steps to participate fully in community of nations And when Soviet Union agreed with so many of us here in United Nations to condemn aggression of Iraq there could be no doubt -- no doubt then -- that we had indeed put four decades of history behind us We are hopeful that machinery of United Nations will no longer be frozen by divisions that plagued us during cold war that at last -- long last -- we can build new bridges and tear down old walls that at long last we will be able to build a new world based on an event for which we have all hoped an end to cold war Two days from now world will be watching when cold war is formally buried in Berlin And in this time of testing a fundamental question must be asked a question not for any one nation but for United Nations And question is this Can we work together in a new partnership of nations? Can collective strength of world community expressed by United Nations unite to deter and defeat aggression? Because cold war's battle of ideas is not last epic battle of this century Two months ago in waning weeks of one of history's most hopeful summers vast still beauty of peaceful Kuwaiti desert was fouled by stench of diesel and roar of steel tanks Once again sound of distant thunder echoed across a cloudless sky and once again world awoke to face guns of August But this time world was ready The United Nations Security Council's resolute response to Iraq's unprovoked aggression has been without precedent Since invasion on August 2d Council has passed eight major resolutions setting terms for a solution to crisis The Iraqi regime has yet to face facts but as said last month annexation of Kuwawill not be permitted to stand And this is not simply view of United States; is view of every Kuwaiti Arab League United Nations Iraq's leaders should listen It is Iraq against world Let me take this opportunity to make policy of my government clear The United States supports use of sanctions to compel Iraq's leaders to withdraw immediately and without condition from Kuwa We also support provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purposes so long as distribution can be properly monitored Our quarrel is not with people of Iraq We do not wish for them to suffer The world's quarrel is with dictator who ordered that invasion Along with others we have dispatched military forces to region to enforce sanctions to deter and if need be defend against further aggression And we seek no advantage for ourselves nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in Saudi Arabia for 1 day longer than is necessary U S forces were sent at request of Saudi Government and American people and this want every single American soldier brought home as soon as this mission is completed Let me also emphasize that all of us here at U N hope that military force will never be used We seek a peaceful outcome a diplomatic outcome And one more thing In aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwa truly believe there may be opportunities for Iraq and Kuwato settle their differences permanently for states of Gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability and for all states and peoples of region to settle conflicts that divide Arabs from Israel But world's key task -- now first and always -- must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerated or rewarded Through U N Security Council Iraq has been fairly judged by a jury of its peers very nations of Earth Today regime stands isolated and out of step with times separated from civilized world not by space but by centuries Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era a dark relic from a dark time It has plundered Kuwa It has terrorized innocent civilians It has held even diplomats hostage Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction But this outrageous disregard for basic human rights does not come as a total surprise Thousands of Iraqis have been executed on political and religious grounds and even more through a genocidal poison gas war waged against Iraq's own Kurdish villagers As a world community we must act not only to deter use of inhumane weapons like mustard and nerve gas but to eliminate weapons entirely And that is why 1 year ago came to General Assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from face of Earth promised that United States would destroy over 98 percent of its stockpile in first 8 years of a chemical weapons ban treaty and 100 percent -- all of them -- in 10 years if all nations with chemical capabilities chemical weapons signed treaty We've stood by those promises In June United States and Soviet Union signed a landmark agreement to halt production and to destroy vast majority of our stockpiles Today U S chemical weapons are being destroyed But time is running out This isn't merely a bilateral concern The Gulf crisis proves how important is to act together and to act now to conclude an absolute worldwide ban on these weapons We must also redouble our efforts to stem spread of nuclear weapons biological weapons and ballistic missiles that can rain destruction upon distant peoples The United Nations can help bring about a new day a day when these kinds of terrible weapons and terrible despots who would use them are both a thing of past It is in our hands to leave these dark machines behind in Dark Ages where they belong and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a new world order and a long era of peace We have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends Cold War a partnership based on consultation cooperation and collective action especially through international and regional organizations; a partnership united by principle and rule of law and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and commitment; a partnership whose goals are to increase democracy increase prosperity increase peace and reduce arms And as we look to future calendar offers up a convenient milestone a signpost by which to measure our progress as a community of nations The year 2000 marks a turning point beginning not only turn of decade not only turn of century but also turn of millennium And 10 years from now as 55th session of General Assembly begins you will again find many of us in this hall hair a bmore gray perhaps maybe a little less spring in our walk; but you will not find us with any less hope or idealism or any less confidence in ultimate triumph of mankind see a world of open borders open trade and most importantly open minds; a world that celebrates common heritage that belongs to all world's people taking pride not just in hometown or homeland but in humanity itself see a world touched by a spirlike that of Olympics based not on competition that's driven by fear but sought out of joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence And see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and convert old foes and where Americas -- North Central and South -- can provide a model for future of all humankind world's first completely democratic hemisphere And see a world building on emerging new model of European unity not just Europe but whole world whole and free This is precisely why present aggression in Gulf is a menace not only to one region's security but to entire world's vision of our future It threatens to turn dream of a new international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy in which law of jungle supplants law of nations And that's why United Nations reacted with such historic unity and resolve And that's why this challenge is a test that we cannot afford to fail am confident we will prevail Success too will have lasting consequences reinforcing civilized standards of international conduct setting a new precedent in international cooperation brightening prospects for our vision of future There are 10 more years until this century is out 10 more years to put struggles of 20th century permanently behind us 10 more years to help launch a new partnership of nations And throughout those 10 years and beginning now United Nations has a new and vital role in building towards that partnership Last year's General Assembly showed how we can make greater progress toward a more pragmatic and successful United Nations And for first time U N Security Council is beginning to work as was designed to work And now is time to set aside old and counterproductive debates and procedures and controversies and resolutions It's time to replace polemic attacks with pragmatic action And we've shown that U N can count on collective strength of international community We've shown that U N can rise to challenge of aggression just as its founders hoped that would And now is time of testing And we must also show that United Nations is place to build international support and consensus for meeting other challenges we face The world remains a dangerous place; and our security and well-being often depends in part on events occurring far away We need serious international cooperative efforts to make headway on threats to environment on terrorism on managing debt burden on fighting scourge of international drug trafficking and on refugees and peacekeeping efforts around world But world also remains a hopeful place Calls for democracy and human rights are being reborn everywhere and these calls are an expression of support for values enshrined in United Nations Charter They encourage our hopes for a more stable more peaceful more prosperous world Free elections are foundation of democratic government and can produce dramatic successes as we have seen in Namibia and Nicaragua And time has come to structure U N role in such efforts more formally And so today propose that U N establish a Special Coordinator for Electoral Assistance to be assisted by a U N Electoral Commission comprised of distinguished experts from around world As with free elections we also believe that universal U N membership for all states is central to future of this organization and to this new partnership we've discussed In support of this principle and in conjunction with U N efforts to reduce regional tensions United States fully supports U N membership for Republic of Korea We do so without prejudice to ultimate objective of reunification of Korean Peninsula and without opposition to simultaneous membership for Democratic People's Republic of Korea Building on these and other initiatives we must join together in a new compact -- all of us -- to bring United Nations into 21st century and call today for a major long-term effort to do so We should build on success -- admirable success -- of our distinguished Secretary-General my longtime friend and yours my longtime colleague might also say Javier Perez de Cuellar We should strive for greater effectiveness and efficiency of United Nations The United States is committed to playing its part helping to maintain global security promoting democracy and prosperity And my administration is fully committed to supporting United Nations and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to Charter International peace and security and international freedom and prosperity require no less The world must know and understand From this hour from this day from this hall we step forth with a new sense of purpose a new sense of possibilities We stand together prepared to swim upstream to march uphill to tackle tough challenges as they come not only as United Nations but as nations of world united And so let be said of final decade of 20th century This was a time when humankind came into its own when we emerged from grand smoke of industrial age to bring about a revolution of spirand mind and began a journey into a new day a new age and a new partnership of nations The U N is now fulfilling its promise as world's parliament of peace And congratulate you support you And wish you Godspeed in challenges ahead very very much

|[very, much, secretary-general, distinguished, delegates, to, united, nations, is, really, a, great, privilege, to, greet, you, today, as, we, begin, what, marks, a, new, and, historic, session, of, general, assembly, my, congratulations, to, honorable, guido, de, marco, on, your, election, sir, as, of, general, assembly, and, on, a, personal, note, want, to, say, that, having, witnessed, unprecedented, unity, and, cooperation, of, past, 2, months, that, have, never, been, prouder, to, have, once, served, within, your, ranks, and, never, been, prouder, that, united, states, is, host, country, for, united, nations, forty-five, years, ago, while, fires, of, an, epic, war, still, raged, across, two, oceans, and, two, continents, a, small, group, of, men, and, women, began, a, search, for, hope, amid, ruins, and, they, gathered, in, san, francisco, stepping, back, from, haze, and, horror, to, try, to, shape, a, new, structure, that, might, support, an, ancient, dream, intensely, idealistic, and, yet, tempered, by, war, they, sought, to, build, a, new, kind, of, bridge, a, bridge, between, nations, a, bridge, that, might, help, carry, humankind, from, its, darkest, hour, to, its, brightest, day, the, founding, of, united, nations, embodied, our, deepest, hopes, for, a, peaceful, world, and, during, past, year, we've, come, closer, than, ever, before, to, realizing, those, hopes, we've, seen, a, century, sundered, by, barbed, threats, and, barbed, wire, give, way, to, a, new, era, of, peace, and, competition, and, freedom, the, revolution, of, '89, swept, world, almost, with, a, life, of, its, own, carried, by, a, new, breeze, of, freedom, it, transformed, political, climate, from, central, europe, to, central, america, and, touched, almost, every, corner, of, globe, that, breeze, has, been, sustained, by, a, now, almost, universal, recognition, of, a, simple, fundamental, truth, the, human, spircannot, be, locked, up, forever, the, truth, is, people, everywhere, are, motivated, in, much, same, ways, and, people, everywhere, want, much, same, things, chance, to, live, a, life, of, purpose;, chance, to, choose, a, life, in, which, they, and, their, children, can, learn, and, grow, healthy, worship, freely, and, prosper, through, work, of, their, hands, and, their, hearts, and, their, minds, we're, not, talking, about, power, of, nations, but, power, of, individuals, power, to, choose, power, to, risk, power, to, succeed, this, is, a, new, and, different, world, not, since, 1945, have, we, seen, real, possibility, of, using, united, nations, as, was, designed, as, a, center, for, international, collective, security, the, changes, in, soviet, union, have, been, critical, to, emergence, of, a, stronger, united, nations, the, u, s, -soviet, relationship, is, finally, beyond, containment, and, confrontation, and, now, we, seek, to, fulfill, promise, of, mutually, shared, understanding, the, long, twilight, struggle, that, for, 45, years, has, divided, europe, our, two, nations, and, much, of, world, has, come, to, an, end, much, has, changed, over, last, 2, years, the, soviet, union, has, taken, many, dramatic, and, important, steps, to, participate, fully, in, community, of, nations, and, when, soviet, union, agreed, with, so, many, of, us, here, in, united, nations, to, condemn, aggression, of, iraq, there, could, be, no, doubt, --, no, doubt, then, --, that, we, had, indeed, put, four, decades, of, history, behind, us, we, are, hopeful, that, machinery, of, united, nations, will, no, longer, be, frozen, by, divisions, that, plagued, us, during, cold, war, that, at, last, --, long, last, --, we, can, build, new, bridges, and, tear, down, old, walls, that, at, long, last, we, will, be, able, to, build, a, new, world, based, on, an, event, for, which, we, have, all, hoped, an, end, to, cold, war, two, days, from, now, world, will, be, watching, when, cold, war, is, formally, buried, in, berlin, and, in, this, time, of, testing, a, fundamental, question, must, be, asked, a, question, not, for, any, one, nation, but, for, united, nations, and, question, is, this, can, we, work, together, in, a, new, partnership, of, nations?, can, collective, strength, of, world, community, expressed, by, united, nations, unite, to, deter, and, defeat, aggression?, because, cold, war's, battle, of, ideas, is, not, last, epic, battle, of, this, century, two, months, ago, in, waning, weeks, of, one, of, history's, most, hopeful, summers, vast, still, beauty, of, peaceful, kuwaiti, desert, was, fouled, by, stench, of, diesel, and, roar, of, steel, tanks, once, again, sound, of, distant, thunder, echoed, across, a, cloudless, sky, and, once, again, world, awoke, to, face, guns, of, august, but, this, time, world, was, ready, the, united, nations, security, council's, resolute, response, to, iraq's, unprovoked, aggression, has, been, without, precedent, since, invasion, on, august, 2d, council, has, passed, eight, major, resolutions, setting, terms, for, a, solution, to, crisis, the, iraqi, regime, has, yet, to, face, facts, but, as, said, last, month, annexation, of, kuwawill, not, be, permitted, to, stand, and, this, is, not, simply, view, of, united, states;, is, view, of, every, kuwaiti, arab, league, united, nations, iraq's, leaders, should, listen, it, is, iraq, against, world, let, me, take, this, opportunity, to, make, policy, of, my, government, clear, the, united, states, supports, use, of, sanctions, to, compel, iraq's, leaders, to, withdraw, immediately, and, without, condition, from, kuwa, we, also, support, provision, of, medicine, and, food, for, humanitarian, purposes, so, long, as, distribution, can, be, properly, monitored, our, quarrel, is, not, with, people, of, iraq, we, do, not, wish, for, them, to, suffer, the, world's, quarrel, is, with, dictator, who, ordered, that, invasion, along, with, others, we, have, dispatched, military, forces, to, region, to, enforce, sanctions, to, deter, and, if, need, be, defend, against, further, aggression, and, we, seek, no, advantage, for, ourselves, nor, do, we, seek, to, maintain, our, military, forces, in, saudi, arabia, for, 1, day, longer, than, is, necessary, u, s, forces, were, sent, at, request, of, saudi, government, and, american, people, and, this, want, every, single, american, soldier, brought, home, as, soon, as, this, mission, is, completed, let, me, also, emphasize, that, all, of, us, here, at, u, n, hope, that, military, force, will, never, be, used, we, seek, a, peaceful, outcome, a, diplomatic, outcome, and, one, more, thing, in, aftermath, of, iraq's, unconditional, departure, from, kuwa, truly, believe, there, may, be, opportunities, for, iraq, and, kuwato, settle, their, differences, permanently, for, states, of, gulf, themselves, to, build, new, arrangements, for, stability, and, for, all, states, and, peoples, of, region, to, settle, conflicts, that, divide, arabs, from, israel, but, world's, key, task, --, now, first, and, always, --, must, be, to, demonstrate, that, aggression, will, not, be, tolerated, or, rewarded, through, u, n, security, council, iraq, has, been, fairly, judged, by, a, jury, of, its, peers, very, nations, of, earth, today, regime, stands, isolated, and, out, of, step, with, times, separated, from, civilized, world, not, by, space, but, by, centuries, iraq's, unprovoked, aggression, is, a, throwback, to, another, era, a, dark, relic, from, a, dark, time, it, has, plundered, kuwa, it, has, terrorized, innocent, civilians, it, has, held, even, diplomats, hostage, iraq, and, its, leaders, must, be, held, liable, for, these, crimes, of, abuse, and, destruction, but, this, outrageous, disregard, for, basic, human, rights, does, not, come, as, a, total, surprise, thousands, of, iraqis, have, been, executed, on, political, and, religious, grounds, and, even, more, through, a, genocidal, poison, gas, war, waged, against, iraq's, own, kurdish, villagers, as, a, world, community, we, must, act, not, only, to, deter, use, of, inhumane, weapons, like, mustard, and, nerve, gas, but, to, eliminate, weapons, entirely, and, that, is, why, 1, year, ago, came, to, general, assembly, with, new, proposals, to, banish, these, terrible, weapons, from, face, of, earth, promised, that, united, states, would, destroy, over, 98, percent, of, its, stockpile, in, first, 8, years, of, a, chemical, weapons, ban, treaty, and, 100, percent, --, all, of, them, --, in, 10, years, if, all, nations, with, chemical, capabilities, chemical, weapons, signed, treaty, we've, stood, by, those, promises, in, june, united, states, and, soviet, union, signed, a, landmark, agreement, to, halt, production, and, to, destroy, vast, majority, of, our, stockpiles, today, u, s, chemical, weapons, are, being, destroyed, but, time, is, running, out, this, isn't, merely, a, bilateral, concern, the, gulf, crisis, proves, how, important, is, to, act, together, and, to, act, now, to, conclude, an, absolute, worldwide, ban, on, these, weapons, we, must, also, redouble, our, efforts, to, stem, spread, of, nuclear, weapons, biological, weapons, and, ballistic, missiles, that, can, rain, destruction, upon, distant, peoples, the, united, nations, can, help, bring, about, a, new, day, a, day, when, these, kinds, of, terrible, weapons, and, terrible, despots, who, would, use, them, are, both, a, thing, of, past, it, is, in, our, hands, to, leave, these, dark, machines, behind, in, dark, ages, where, they, belong, and, to, press, forward, to, cap, a, historic, movement, towards, a, new, world, order, and, a, long, era, of, peace, we, have, a, vision, of, a, new, partnership, of, nations, that, transcends, cold, war, a, partnership, based, on, consultation, cooperation, and, collective, action, especially, through, international, and, regional, organizations;, a, partnership, united, by, principle, and, rule, of, law, and, supported, by, an, equitable, sharing, of, both, cost, and, commitment;, a, partnership, whose, goals, are, to, increase, democracy, increase, prosperity, increase, peace, and, reduce, arms, and, as, we, look, to, future, calendar, offers, up, a, convenient, milestone, a, signpost, by, which, to, measure, our, progress, as, a, community, of, nations, the, year, 2000, marks, a, turning, point, beginning, not, only, turn, of, decade, not, only, turn, of, century, but, also, turn, of, millennium, and, 10, years, from, now, as, 55th, session, of, general, assembly, begins, you, will, again, find, many, of, us, in, this, hall, hair, a, bmore, gray, perhaps, maybe, a, little, less, spring, in, our, walk;, but, you, will, not, find, us, with, any, less, hope, or, idealism, or, any, less, confidence, in, ultimate, triumph, of, mankind, see, a, world, of, open, borders, open, trade, and, most, importantly, open, minds;, a, world, that, celebrates, common, heritage, that, belongs, to, all, world's, people, taking, pride, not, just, in, hometown, or, homeland, but, in, humanity, itself, see, a, world, touched, by, a, spirlike, that, of, olympics, based, not, on, competition, that's, driven, by, fear, but, sought, out, of, joy, and, exhilaration, and, a, true, quest, for, excellence, and, see, a, world, where, democracy, continues, to, win, new, friends, and, convert, old, foes, and, where, americas, --, north, central, and, south, --, can, provide, a, model, for, future, of, all, humankind, world's, first, completely, democratic, hemisphere, and, see, a, world, building, on, emerging, new, model, of, european, unity, not, just, europe, but, whole, world, whole, and, free, this, is, precisely, why, present, aggression, in, gulf, is, a, menace, not, only, to, one, region's, security, but, to, entire, world's, vision, of, our, future, it, threatens, to, turn, dream, of, a, new, international, order, into, a, grim, nightmare, of, anarchy, in, which, law, of, jungle, supplants, law, of, nations, and, that's, why, united, nations, reacted, with, such, historic, unity, and, resolve, and, that's, why, this, challenge, is, a, test, that, we, cannot, afford, to, fail, am, confident, we, will, prevail, success, too, will, have, lasting, consequences, reinforcing, civilized, standards, of, international, conduct, setting, a, new, precedent, in, international, cooperation, brightening, prospects, for, our, vision, of, future, there, are, 10, more, years, until, this, century, is, out, 10, more, years, to, put, struggles, of, 20th, century, permanently, behind, us, 10, more, years, to, help, launch, a, new, partnership, of, nations, and, throughout, those, 10, years, and, beginning, now, united, nations, has, a, new, and, vital, role, in, building, towards, that, partnership, last, year's, general, assembly, showed, how, we, can, make, greater, progress, toward, a, more, pragmatic, and, successful, united, nations, and, for, first, time, u, n, security, council, is, beginning, to, work, as, was, designed, to, work, and, now, is, time, to, set, aside, old, and, counterproductive, debates, and, procedures, and, controversies, and, resolutions, it's, time, to, replace, polemic, attacks, with, pragmatic, action, and, we've, shown, that, u, n, can, count, on, collective, strength, of, international, community, we've, shown, that, u, n, can, rise, to, challenge, of, aggression, just, as, its, founders, hoped, that, would, and, now, is, time, of, testing, and, we, must, also, show, that, united, nations, is, place, to, build, international, support, and, consensus, for, meeting, other, challenges, we, face, the, world, remains, a, dangerous, place;, and, our, security, and, well-being, often, depends, in, part, on, events, occurring, far, away, we, need, serious, international, cooperative, efforts, to, make, headway, on, threats, to, environment, on, terrorism, on, managing, debt, burden, on, fighting, scourge, of, international, drug, trafficking, and, on, refugees, and, peacekeeping, efforts, around, world, but, world, also, remains, a, hopeful, place, calls, for, democracy, and, human, rights, are, being, reborn, everywhere, and, these, calls, are, an, expression, of, support, for, values, enshrined, in, united, nations, charter, they, encourage, our, hopes, for, a, more, stable, more, peaceful, more, prosperous, world, free, elections, are, foundation, of, democratic, government, and, can, produce, dramatic, successes, as, we, have, seen, in, namibia, and, nicaragua, and, time, has, come, to, structure, u, n, role, in, such, efforts, more, formally, and, so, today, propose, that, u, n, establish, a, special, coordinator, for, electoral, assistance, to, be, assisted, by, a, u, n, electoral, commission, comprised, of, distinguished, experts, from, around, world, as, with, free, elections, we, also, believe, that, universal, u, n, membership, for, all, states, is, central, to, future, of, this, organization, and, to, this, new, partnership, we've, discussed, in, support, of, this, principle, and, in, conjunction, with, u, n, efforts, to, reduce, regional, tensions, united, states, fully, supports, u, n, membership, for, republic, of, korea, we, do, so, without, prejudice, to, ultimate, objective, of, reunification, of, korean, peninsula, and, without, opposition, to, simultaneous, membership, for, democratic, people's, republic, of, korea, building, on, these, and, other, initiatives, we, must, join, together, in, a, new, compact, --, all, of, us, --, to, bring, united, nations, into, 21st, century, and, call, today, for, a, major, long-term, effort, to, do, so, we, should, build, on, success, --, admirable, success, --, of, our, distinguished, secretary-general, my, longtime, friend, and, yours, my, longtime, colleague, might, also, say, javier, perez, de, cuellar, we, should, strive, for, greater, effectiveness, and, efficiency, of, united, nations, the, united, states, is, committed, to, playing, its, part, helping, to, maintain, global, security, promoting, democracy, and, prosperity, and, my, administration, is, fully, committed, to, supporting, united, nations, and, to, paying, what, we, are, obliged, to, pay, by, our, commitment, to, charter, international, peace, and, security, and, international, freedom, and, prosperity, require, no, less, the, world, must, know, and, understand, from, this, hour, from, this, day, from, this, hall, we, step, forth, with, a, new, sense, of, purpose, a, new, sense, of, possibilities, we, stand, together, prepared, to, swim, upstream, to, march, uphill, to, tackle, tough, challenges, as, they, come, not, only, as, united, nations, but, as, nations, of, world, united, and, so, let, be, said, of, final, decade, of, 20th, century, this, was, a, time, when, humankind, came, into, its, own, when, we, emerged, from, grand, smoke, of, industrial, age, to, bring, about, a, revolution, of, spirand, mind, and, began, a, journey, into, a, new, day, a, new, age, and, a, new, partnership, of, nations, the, u, n, is, now, fulfilling, its, promise, as, world's, parliament,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"Tonight want to talk to you about a problem that has lingered and dogged and vexed this country for far too long Federal budget defic Thomas Paine said many years ago \"\"These are times that try men's souls \"\" As we speak our nation is standing together against Saddam Hussein's aggression But here at home there's another threat a cancer gnawing away at our nation's health That cancer is budget defic Year after year mortgages future of our children No family no nation can continue to do business way Federal Government has been operating and survive When you get a bill that bill must be paid And when you write a check you're supposed to have money in bank But if you don't obey these simple rules of common sense there's a price to pay But for too long Nation's business in Washington has been conducted as if these basic rules did not apply Well these rules do apply And if we fail to act next year alone we will face a Federal budget deficof more than $300 billion a deficthat could weaken our economy further and cost us thousands of precious jobs If what goes up must come down then way down could be very hard But doesn't have to be that way We can do something In fact we have started to do something But we must act this week when Congress will hold first of two crucial up-or-down votes These votes will be on a deficreduction agreement worked out between administration and bipartisan leaders of Congress This budget agreement is result of 8 months of blood sweat and fears -- fears of economic chaos that would follow if we fail to reduce defic Of course cannot claim it's best deficreduction plan possible It's not Any one of us alone might have written a better plan But is best agreement that can be legislated now It is biggest deficreduction agreement ever -- half a trillion dollars It's toughest deficreduction package ever with new enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed And has largest spending savings ever -- more than $300 billion For first time a Republican and leaders of a Democratic Congress have agreed to real cuts that will be enforced by law not promises -- no smoke no mirrors no magic act but real and lasting spending cuts This agreement will also raise revenue I'm not and know you're not a fan of tax increases But if there have to be tax measures they should allow economy to grow they should not turn us back to higher income tax rates and they should be fair Everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have to contribute beyond their fair share Our bipartisan agreement meets these tests And through specific new incentives will help create more jobs It's a little-known fact but America's best job creators and greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies So our budget plan will give small and medium-size companies a needed shot in arm Just as important am convinced that this agreement will help lower interest rates And lower interest rates mean savings for consumers lower mortgage payments for new homeowners and more investment to produce more jobs And that's what this agreement will do Now let me tell you what this agreement will not do It will not raise income tax rates personal or corporate It will not mess with Social Security in any way It will not put America's national security at risk And most of all will not let our economy slip out of control Clearly each and every one of us can find fault with something in this agreement In fact that is a burden that any truly fair solution must carry Any workable solution must be judged as a whole not piece by piece Those who dislike one part or another may pick our agreement apart But if they do believe me political reality is no one can put a better one back together again Everyone will bear a small burden But if we succeed every American will have a large burden lifted If we fail to enact this agreement our economy will falter markets may tumble and recession will follow In just a moment Democratic majority leader Senator Mitchell will offer what is known as Democratic response often a rebuttal But not tonight Tonight Democratic and Republican leadership and all speak with one voice in support of this agreement Tonight we ask you to help us move this agreement forward The congressional leadership and both have a job to do in getting enacted And tonight ask for your help First ask you to understand how important -- and for some how difficult -- this vote is for your Congressmen and Senators Many worry about your reaction to one part or another But know you know importance of whole And so second ask you to take this initiative Tell your Congressmen and Senators you support this deficreduction agreement If they are Republicans urge them to stand with Urge them to do what bipartisan leadership has done come together in spirof compromise to solve this national problem If they're Democrats urge them to stand with their congressional leaders Ask them to fight for future of your kids by supporting this budget agreement Now is time for you American people to have a real impact Your Senators and Congressmen need to know that you want this deficbrought down that time for politics and posturing is over and time to come together is now This deficreduction agreement is tough and so are times The agreement is fair and so is American spir The agreement is bipartisan and so is vote The agreement is real and so is this crisis This is first time in my Presidency that I've made an appeal like this to you American people With your help we can at last put this budget crisis behind us and face other challenges that lie ahead If we do long-term result will be a healthier nation and something more We will have once again put ourselves on path of economic growth and we will have demonstrated that no challenge is greater than determination of American people God bless you and good night\"

we, can, do, something, in, fact, we, have, started, to, do, something, but, we, must, act, this, week, when, congress, will, hold, first, of, two, crucial, up-or-down, votes, these, votes, will, be, on, a, deficreduction, agreement, worked, out, between, administration, and, bipartisan, leaders, of, congress, this, budget, agreement, is, result, of, 8, months, of, blood, sweat, and, fears, --, fears, of, economic, chaos, that, would, follow, if, we, fail, to, reduce, defic, of, course, cannot, claim, it's, best, deficreduction, plan, possible, it's, not, any, one, of, us, alone, might, have, written, a, better, plan, but, is, best, agreement, that, can, be, legislated, now, it, is, biggest, deficreduction, agreement, ever, --, half, a, trillion, dollars, it's, toughest, deficreduction, package, ever, with, new, enforcement, rules, to, make, sure, that, what, we, fix, now, stays, fixed, and, has, largest, spending, savings, ever, --, more, than, $300, billion, for, first, time, a, republican, and, leaders, of, a, democratic, congress, have, agreed, to, real, cuts, that, will, be, enforced, by, law, not, promises, --, no, smoke, no, mirrors, no, magic, act, but, real, and, lasting, spending, cuts, this, agreement, will, also, raise, revenue, i'm, not, and, know, you're, not, a, fan, of, tax, increases, but, if, there, have, to, be, tax, measures, they, should, allow, economy, to, grow, they, should, not, turn, us, back, to, higher, income, tax, rates, and, they, should, be, fair, everyone, who, can, should, contribute, something, and, no, one, should, have, to, contribute, beyond, their, fair, share, our, bipartisan, agreement, meets, these, tests, and, through, specific, new, incentives, will, help, create, more, jobs, it's, a, little-known, fact, but, america's, best, job, creators, and, greatest, innovators, tend, to, be, our, smaller, companies, so, our, budget, plan, will, give, small, and, medium-size, companies, a, needed, shot, in, arm, just, as, important, am, convinced, that, this, agreement, will, help, lower, interest, rates, and, lower, interest, rates, mean, savings, for, consumers, lower, mortgage, payments, for, new, homeowners, and, more, investment, to, produce, more, jobs, and, that's, what, this, agreement, will, do, now, let, me, tell, you, what, this, agreement, will, not, do, it, will, not, raise, income, tax, rates, personal, or, corporate, it, will, not, mess, with, social, security, in, any, way, it, will, not, put, america's, national, security, at, risk, and, most, of, all, will, not, let, our, economy, slip, out, of, control, clearly, each, and, every, one, of, us, can, find, fault, with, something, in, this, agreement, in, fact, that, is, a, burden, that, any, truly, fair, solution, must, carry, any, workable, solution, must, be, judged, as, a, whole, not, piece, by, piece, those, who, dislike, one, part, or, another, may, pick, our, agreement, apart, but, if, they, do, believe, me, political, reality, is, no, one, can, put, a, better, one, back, together, again, everyone, will, bear, a, small, burden, but, if, we, succeed, every, american, will, have, a, large, burden, lifted, if, we, fail, to, enact, this, agreement, our, economy, will, falter, markets, may, tumble, and, recession, will, follow, in, just, a, moment, democratic, majority, leader, senator, mitchell, will, offer, what, is, known, as, democratic, response, often, a, rebuttal, but, not, tonight, tonight, democratic, and, republican, leadership, and, all, speak, with, one, voice, in, support, of, this, agreement, tonight, we, ask, you, to, help, us, move, this, agreement, forward, the, congressional, leadership, and, both, have, a, job, to, do, in, getting, enacted, and, tonight, ask, for, your, help, first, ask, you, to, understand, how, important, --, and, for, some, how, difficult, --, this, vote, is, for, your, congressmen, and, senators, many, worry, about, your, reaction, to, one, part, or, another, but, know, you, know, importance, of, whole, and, so, second, ask, you, to, take, this, initiative, tell, your, congressmen, and, senators, you, support, this, deficreduction, agreement, if, they, are, republicans, urge, them, to, stand, with, urge, them, to, do, what, bipartisan, leadership, has, done, come, together, in, spirof, compromise, to, solve, this, national, problem, if, they're, democrats, urge, them, to, stand, with, their, congressional, leaders, ask, them, to, fight, for, future, of, your, kids, by, supporting, this, budget, agreement, now, is, time, for, you, american, people, to, have, a, real, impact, your, senators, and, congressmen, need, to, know, that, you, want, this, deficbrought, down, that, time, for, politics, and, posturing, is, over, and, time, to, come, together, is, now, this, deficreduction, agreement, is, tough, and, so, are, times, the, agreement, is, fair, and, so, is, american, spir, the, agreement, is, bipartisan, and, so, is, vote, the, agreement, is, real, and, so, is, this, crisis, this, is, first, time, in, my, presidency, that, i've, made, an, appeal, like, this, to, you, american, people, with, your, help, we, can, at, last, put, this, budget, crisis, behind, us, and, face, other, challenges, that, lie, ahead, if, we, do, long-term, result, will, be, a, healthier, nation, and, something, more, we, will, have, once, again, put, ourselves, on, path, of, economic, growth, and, we, will, have, demonstrated, that, no, challenge, is, greater, than, determination, of, american,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"Just 2 hours ago allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwa These attacks continue as speak Ground forces are not engaged This conflict started August 2d when dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor Kuwa-- a member of Arab League and a member of United Nations -- was crushed; its people brutalized Five months ago Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwa Tonight battle has been joined This military action taken in accord with United Nations resolutions and with consent of United States Congress follows months of constant and virtually endless diplomatic activity on part of United Nations United States and many many other countries Arab leaders sought what became known as an Arab solution only to conclude that Saddam Hussein was unwilling to leave Kuwa Others traveled to Baghdad in a variety of efforts to restore peace and justice Our Secretary of State James Baker held an historic meeting in Geneva only to be totally rebuffed This past weekend in a last-ditch effort Secretary-General of United Nations went to Middle East with peace in his heart -- his second such mission And he came back from Baghdad with no progress at all in getting Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwa Now 28 countries with forces in Gulf area have exhausted all reasonable efforts to reach a peaceful resolution -- have no choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwaby force We will not fail As report to you air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities Much of Saddam's artillery and tanks will be destroyed Our operations are designed to best protect lives of all coalition forces by targeting Saddam's vast military arsenal Initial reports from General Schwarzkopf are that our operations are proceeding according to plan Our objectives are clear Saddam Hussein's forces will leave Kuwa The legitimate government of Kuwawill be restored to its rightful place and Kuwawill once again be free Iraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions and then when peace is restored is our hope that Iraq will live as a peaceful and cooperative member of family of nations thus enhancing security and stability of Gulf Some may ask Why act now? Why not wait? The answer is clear The world could wano longer Sanctions though having some effect showed no signs of accomplishing their objective Sanctions were tried for well over 5 months and we and our allies concluded that sanctions alone would not force Saddam from Kuwa While world waited Saddam Hussein systematically raped pillaged and plundered a tiny nation no threat to his own He subjected people of Kuwato unspeakable atrocities -- and among those maimed and murdered innocent children While world waited Saddam sought to add to chemical weapons arsenal he now possesses an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction -- a nuclear weapon And while world waited while world talked peace and withdrawal Saddam Hussein dug in and moved massive forces into Kuwa While world waited while Saddam stalled more damage was being done to fragile economies of Third World emerging democracies of Eastern Europe to entire world including to our own economy The United States together with United Nations exhausted every means at our disposal to bring this crisis to a peaceful end However Saddam clearly felt that by stalling and threatening and defying United Nations he could weaken forces arrayed against him While world waited Saddam Hussein met every overture of peace with open contempt While world prayed for peace Saddam prepared for war had hoped that when United States Congress in historic debate took its resolute action Saddam would realize he could not prevail and would move out of Kuwain accord with United Nation resolutions He did not do that Instead he remained intransigent certain that time was on his side Saddam was warned over and over again to comply with will of United Nations Leave Kuwa or be driven out Saddam has arrogantly rejected all warnings Instead he tried to make this a dispute between Iraq and United States of America Well he failed Tonight 28 nations -- countries from 5 continents Europe and Asia Africa and Arab League -- have forces in Gulf area standing shoulder to shoulder against Saddam Hussein These countries had hoped use of force could be avoided Regrettably we now believe that only force will make him leave Prior to ordering our forces into battle instructed our military commanders to take every necessary step to prevail as quickly as possible and with greatest degree of protection possible for American and allied service men and women I've told American people before that this will not be another Vietnam and repeat this here tonight Our troops will have best possible support in entire world and they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back I'm hopeful that this fighting will not go on for long and that casualties will be held to an absolute minimum This is an historic moment We have in this past year made great progress in ending long era of conflict and cold war We have before us opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order -- a world where rule of law not law of jungle governs conduct of nations When we are successful -- and we will be -- we have a real chance at this new world order an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill promise and vision of U N 's founders We have no argument with people of Iraq Indeed for innocents caught in this conflict pray for their safety Our goal is not conquest of Iraq It is liberation of Kuwa It is my hope that somehow Iraqi people can even now convince their dictator that he must lay down his arms leave Kuwa and let Iraq itself rejoin family of peace-loving nations Thomas Paine wrote many years ago \"\"These are times that try men's souls \"\" Those well-known words are so very true today But even as planes of multinational forces attack Iraq prefer to think of peace not war am convinced not only that we will prevail but that out of horror of combat will come recognition that no nation can stand against a world united no nation will be permitted to brutally assault its neighbor No can easily commour sons and daughters to war They are Nation's finest Ours is an all-volunteer force magnificently trained highly motivated The troops know why they're there And listen to what they say for they've said better than any or Prime Minister ever could Listen to Hollywood Huddleston Marine lance corporal He says \"\"Let's free these people so we can go home and be free again \"\" And he's right The terrible crimes and tortures committed by Saddam's henchmen against innocent people of Kuwaare an affront to mankind and a challenge to freedom of all Listen to one of our great officers out there Marine Lieutenant General Walter Boomer He said \"\"There are things worth fighting for A world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go unchecked isn't kind of world we're going to want to live in \"\" Listen to Master Sergeant J P Kendall of 82d Airborne \"\"We're here for more than just price of a gallon of gas What we're doing is going to chart future of world for next 100 years It's better to deal with this guy now than 5 years from now \"\" And finally we should all sup and listen to Jackie Jones an Army lieutenant when she says \"\"If we let him get away with this who knows what's going to be next?\"\" have called upon Hollywood and Walter and J P and Jackie and all their courageous comrades-in-arms to do what must be done Tonight America and world are deeply grateful to them and to their families And let me say to everyone listening or watching tonight When troops we've sent in finish their work am determined to bring them home as soon as possible Tonight as our forces fight they and their families are in our prayers May God bless each and every one of them and coalition forces at our side in Gulf and may He continue to bless our nation United States of America\"

saddam's, artillery, and, tanks, will, be, destroyed, our, operations, are, designed, to, best, protect, lives, of, all, coalition, forces, by, targeting, saddam's, vast, military, arsenal, initial, reports, from, general, schwarzkopf, are, that, our, operations, are, proceeding, according, to, plan, our, objectives, are, clear, saddam, hussein's, forces, will, leave, kuwa, the, legitimate, government, of, kuwawill, be, restored, to, its, rightful, place, and, kuwawill, once, again, be, free, iraq, will, eventually, comply, with, all, relevant, united, nations, resolutions, and, then, when, peace, is, restored, is, our, hope, that, iraq, will, live, as, a, peaceful, and, cooperative, member, of, family, of, nations, thus, enhancing, security, and, stability, of, gulf, some, may, ask, why, act, now?, why, not, wait?, the, answer, is, clear, the, world, could, wano, longer, sanctions, though, having, some, effect, showed, no, signs, of, accomplishing, their, objective, sanctions, were, tried, for, well, over, 5, months, and, we, and, our, allies, concluded, that, sanctions, alone, would, not, force, saddam, from, kuwa, while, world, waited, saddam, hussein, systematically, raped, pillaged, and, plundered, a, tiny, nation, no, threat, to, his, own, he, subjected, people, of, kuwato, unspeakable, atrocities, --, and, among, those, maimed, and, murdered, innocent, children, while, world, waited, saddam, sought, to, add, to, chemical, weapons, arsenal, he, now, possesses, an, infinitely, more, dangerous, weapon, of, mass, destruction, --, a, nuclear, weapon, and, while, world, waited, while, world, talked, peace, and, withdrawal, saddam, hussein, dug, in, and, moved, massive, forces, into, kuwa, while, world, waited, while, saddam, stalled, more, damage, was, being, done, to, fragile, economies, of, third, world, emerging, democracies, of, eastern, europe, to, entire, world, including, to, our, own, economy, the, united, states, together, with, united, nations, exhausted, every, means, at, our, disposal, to, bring, this, crisis, to, a, peaceful, end, however, saddam, clearly, felt, that, by, stalling, and, threatening, and, defying, united, nations, he, could, weaken, forces, arrayed, against, him, while, world, waited, saddam, hussein, met, every, overture, of, peace, with, open, contempt, while, world, prayed, for, peace, saddam, prepared, for, war, had, hoped, that, when, united, states, congress, in, historic, debate, took, its, resolute, action, saddam, would, realize, he, could, not, prevail, and, would, move, out, of, kuwain, accord, with, united, nation, resolutions, he, did, not, do, that, instead, he, remained, intransigent, certain, that, time, was, on, his, side, saddam, was, warned, over, and, over, again, to, comply, with, will, of, united, nations, leave, kuwa, or, be, driven, out, saddam, has, arrogantly, rejected, all, warnings, instead, he, tried, to, make, this, a, dispute, between, iraq, and, united, states, of, america, well, he, failed, tonight, 28, nations, --, countries, from, 5, continents, europe, and, asia, africa, and, arab, league, --, have, forces, in, gulf, area, standing, shoulder, to, shoulder, against, saddam, hussein, these, countries, had, hoped, use, of, force, could, be, avoided, regrettably, we, now, believe, that, only, force, will, make, him, leave, prior, to, ordering, our, forces, into, battle, instructed, our, military, commanders, to, take, every, necessary, step, to, prevail, as, quickly, as, possible, and, with, greatest, degree, of, protection, possible, for, american, and, allied, service, men, and, women, i've, told, american, people, before, that, this, will, not, be, another, vietnam, and, repeat, this, here, tonight, our, troops, will, have, best, possible, support, in, entire, world, and, they, will, not, be, asked, to, fight, with, one, hand, tied, behind, their, back, i'm, hopeful, that, this, fighting, will, not, go, on, for, long, and, that, casualties, will, be, held, to, an, absolute, minimum, this, is, an, historic, moment, we, have, in, this, past, year, made, great, progress, in, ending, long, era, of, conflict, and, cold, war, we, have, before, us, opportunity, to, forge, for, ourselves, and, for, future, generations, a, new, world, order, --, a, world, where, rule, of, law, not, law, of, jungle, governs, conduct, of, nations, when, we, are, successful, --, and, we, will, be, --, we, have, a, real, chance, at, this, new, world, order, an, order, in, which, a, credible, united, nations, can, use, its, peacekeeping, role, to, fulfill, promise, and, vision, of, u, n, 's, founders, we, have, no, argument, with, people, of, iraq, indeed, for, innocents, caught, in, this, conflict, pray, for, their, safety, our, goal, is, not, conquest, of, iraq, it, is, liberation, of, kuwa, it, is, my, hope, that, somehow, iraqi, people, can, even, now, convince, their, dictator, that, he, must, lay, down, his, arms, leave, kuwa, and, let, iraq, itself, rejoin, family, of, peace-loving, nations, thomas, paine, wrote, many, years, ago, \"\"these, are, times, that, try, men's, souls, \"\", those, well-known, words, are, so, very, true, today, but, even, as, planes, of, multinational, forces, attack, iraq, prefer, to, think, of, peace, not, war, am, convinced, not, only, that, we, will, prevail, but, that, out, of, horror, of, combat, will, come, recognition, that, no, nation, can, stand, against, a, world, united, no, nation, will, be, permitted, to, brutally, assault, its, neighbor, no, can, easily, commour, sons, and, daughters, to, war, they, are, nation's, finest, ours, is, an, all-volunteer, force, magnificently, trained, highly, motivated, the, troops, know, why, they're, there, and, listen, to, what, they, say, for, they've, said, better, than, any, or, prime, minister, ever, could, listen, to, hollywood, huddleston, marine, lance, corporal, he, says, \"\"let's, free, these, people, so, we, can, go, home, and, be, free, again, \"\", and, he's, right, the, terrible, crimes, and, tortures, committed, by, saddam's, henchmen, against, innocent, people, of, kuwaare, an, affront, to, mankind, and, a, challenge, to, freedom, of, all, listen, to, one, of, our, great, officers, out, there, marine, lieutenant, general, walter, boomer, he, said, \"\"there, are, things, worth, fighting, for, a, world, in, which, brutality, and, lawlessness, are, allowed, to, go, unchecked, isn't, kind, of, world, we're, going, to, want, to, live, in, \"\", listen, to, master, sergeant, j, p, kendall, of, 82d, airborne, \"\"we're, here, for, more, than, just, price, of, a, gallon, of, gas, what, we're, doing, is, going, to, chart, future, of, world, for, next, 100, years, it's, better, to, deal, with, this, guy, now, than, 5, years, from, now, \"\", and, finally, we, should, all, sup, and, listen, to, jackie, jones, an, army, lieutenant, when, she, says, \"\"if, we, let, him, get, away, with, this, who, knows, what's, going, to, be, next?\"\", have, called, upon, hollywood, and, walter, and, j, p, and, jackie, and, all, their, courageous, comrades-in-arms, to, do, what, must, be, done, tonight, america, and, world, are, deeply, grateful, to, them, and, to, their, families, and, let, me, say, to, everyone, listening, or, watching, tonight, when, troops, we've, sent, in, finish,

Which of our citizens will lead us in this next American century? Everyone who steps forward today -- to get one addict off drugs to convince one troubled teenager not to give up on life to comfort one AIDS patient to help one hungry child We have within our reach promise of a renewed America We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher purpose than ourselves a shining purpose illumination of a Thousand Points of Light And is expressed by all who know irresistible force of a child's hand of a friend who stands by you and stays there a volunteer's generous gesture an idea that is simply right The problems before us may be different but key to solving them remains same It is individual -- individual who steps forward And state of our Union is union of each of us one to other -- sum of our friendships marriages families and communities We all have something to give So if you know how to read find someone who can't If you've got a hammer find a nail If you're not hungry not lonely not in trouble seek out someone who is Join community of conscience Do hard work of freedom And that will define state of our Union Since birth of our nation \"\"We People\"\" has been source of our strength What government can do alone is limited but potential of American people knows no limits We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism We are Americans We are nation that believes in future We are nation that can shape future And we've begun to do just that by strengthening power and choice of individuals and families Together these last two years we've put dollars for child care directly in hands of parents instead of bureaucracies; unshackled potential of Americans with disabilities; applied creativity of marketplace in service of environment for clean air; and made home ownership possible for more Americans The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy It is in people and their communities In everything we do let us unleash potential of our most precious resource -- our citizens our citizens themselves We must return to families communities counties cities States and institutions of every kind power to chart their own destiny and freedom and opportunity provided by strong economic growth And that's what America is all about know that tonight in some regions of our country people are in genuine economic distress And hear them Earlier this month Kathy Blackwell of Massachusetts wrote me about what can happen when economy slows down saying \"\"My heart is aching and think that you should know your people out here are hurting badly \"\" understand and I'm not unrealistic about future But there are reasons to be optimistic about our economy First we don't have to fight double-diginflation Second most industries won't have to make big cuts in production because they don't have big inventories piled up And third our exports are running solid and strong In fact American businesses are exporting at a record rate So let's put these times in perspective Together since 1981 we've created almost 20 million jobs cut inflation in half and cut interest rates in half And yes largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been temporarily interrupted But our economy is still over twice as large as our closest competitor We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon We will get on our way to a new record of expansion and achieve competitive strength that will carry us into next American century We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth investing in future and giving power and opportunity to individual We must begin with control of federal spending That's why I'm submitting a budget that holds growth in spending to less than rate of inflation And that's why amid all sound and fury of last year's budget debate we put into law new enforceable spending caps so that future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas not a bidding war Though controversial budget agreement finally put federal government on a pay-as-you-go plan and cut growth of debt by nearly $500 billion And that frees funds for saving and job-creating investment Now let's do more My budget again includes tax-free family savings accounts; penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for first-time home buyers; and to increase jobs and growth a reduced tax for long-term capital gains know there are differences among us -- laughter -- about impact and effects of a capital gains incentive So tonight I'm asking congressional leaders and Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study led by Chairman Alan Greenspan to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in future they must also be matched by long-term investments for next American century That requires a forward-looking plan of action and that's exactly what we will be sending to Congress We've prepared a detailed series of proposals that include a budget that promotes investment in America's future -- in children education infrastructure space and high technology; legislation to achieve excellence in education building on partnership forged with 50 Governors at education summ enabling parents to choose their children's schools and helping to make America number one in math and science; a blueprint for a new national highway system a critical investment in our transportation infrastructure; a research and development agenda that includes record levels of federal investment and a permanent tax credto strengthen private R and D and to create jobs; a comprehensive national energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency increased development and greater use of alternative fuels; a banking reform plan to bring America's financial system into 21st century so that our banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make job-creating loans for our factories our businesses and home buyers You know do think there has been too much pessimism Sound banks should be making sound loans now and interest rates should be lower now In addition to these proposals we must recognize that our economic strength depends on being competitive in world markets We must continue to expand American exports A successful Uruguay round of world trade negotiations will create more real jobs and more real growth for all nations You and know that if playing field is level America's workers and farmers can out-work out-produce anyone anytime anywhere And with a Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for Americas Initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere The budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more power and opportunity in hands of individual And that means new incentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment through enterprise zones It also means tenant control and ownership of public housing Freedom and power to choose should not be privilege of wealth They are birthright of every American Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity Every one of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism bigotry and hate We will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes and will once again press Congress to strengthen laws against employment discrimination without resorting to use of unfair preferences We're determined to protect another fundamental civil right freedom from crime and fear that stalks our cities The Attorney General will soon convene a crime summof our nation's law enforcement officials And to help us support them we need tough crime control legislation and we need now And as we fight crime we will fully implement our national strategy for combating drug abuse Recent data show that we are making progress but much remains to be done We will not rest until day of dealer is over forever Good health care is every American's right and every American's responsibility And so we are proposing an aggressive program of new prevention initiatives -- for infants for children for adults and for elderly -- to promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from spiraling It's time to give people more choice in government by reviving ideal of citizen politician who comes not to stay but to serve And one of reasons that there is so much support across this country for term limitations is that American people are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in politics So we must look beyond next election to next generation And time has come to put national interest above special interest and to totally eliminate political action committees And that would truly put more competition in elections and more power in hands of individuals And where power cannot be put directly in hands of individual should be moved closer to people away from Washington The federal government too often treats government programs as if they are of Washington by Washington and for Washington Once established federal programs seem to become immortal It's time for a more dynamic program life cycle Some programs should increase Some should decrease Some should be terminated And some should be consolidated and turned over to states My budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more than $20 billion Working with Congress and Governors propose we select at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to states in a single consolidated grant fully funded for flexible management by states The value value of this turnover approach is straightforward It allows federal government to reduce overhead It allows states to manage more flexibly and more efficiently It moves power and decisionmaking closer to people And reinforces a theme of this administration appreciation and encouragement of innovative powers of states as laboratories This nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in hands of people And they planned for future And so must we here and all around world As Americans we know that there are times when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead world away from dark chaos of dictators toward brighter promise of a better day Almost 50 years ago we began a long struggle against aggressive totalitarianism Now we face another defining hour for America and world There is no one more devoted more committed to hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor every marine airman and coastguardsman every man and woman now serving in Persian Gulf Oh how they deserve -- applause -- and what a fitting tribute to them You see -- what a wonderful fitting tribute to them Each of them has volunteered volunteered to provide for this nation's defense and now they bravely struggle to earn for America for world and for future generations a just and lasting peace Our commitment to them must be equal to their commitment to their country They are truly America's finest The war in Gulf is not a war we wanted We worked hard to avoid war For more than five months we -- along with Arab League European Community United Nations -- tried every diplomatic avenue U N Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev Mitterrand Ozal Mubarak and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and Andreotti -- just to name a few -- all worked for a solution But time and again Saddam Hussein flatly rejected path of diplomacy and peace The world well knows how this conflict began and when It began on August 2nd when Saddam invaded and sacked a small defenseless neighbor And am certain of how will end So that peace can prevail we will prevail Applause Tonight am pleased to report that we are on course Iraq's capacity to sustain war is being destroyed Our investment our training our planning -- all are paying off Time will not be Saddam's salvation Our purpose in Persian Gulf remains constant to drive Iraq out of Kuwa to restore Kuwait's legitimate government and to ensure stability and security of this critical region Let me make clear what mean by region's stability and security We do not seek destruction of Iraq its culture or its people Rather we seek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy not to serve ambitions of a tyrant but to build a better life for itself and its neighbors We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer rule where strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate weak Most Americans know instinctively why we are in Gulf They know we had to stop Saddam now not later They know that this brutal dictator will do anything will use any weapon will commany outrage no matter how many innocents suffer They know we must make sure that control of world's oil resources does not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression They know that we need to build a new enduring peace based not on arms races and confrontation but on shared principles and rule of law And we all realize that our responsibility to be catalyst for peace in region does not end with successful conclusion of this war Democracy brings undeniable value of thoughtful dissent and we've heard some dissenting voices here at home -- some a handful reckless; most responsible But fact that all voices have right to speak out is one of reasons we've been united in purpose and principle for 200 years Our progress in this great struggle is result of years of vigilance and a steadfast commitment to a strong defense Now with remarkable technological advances like Patriot missile we can defend against ballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians Looking forward have directed that SD program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes whatever their source Let us pursue an SD program that can deal with any future threat to United States to our forces overseas and to our friends and allies The quality of American technology thanks to American worker has enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions and help minimize precious loss of life We have given our men and women very best And they deserve We all have a special place in our hearts for families of our men and women serving in Gulf They are represented here tonight by Mrs Norman Schwarzkopf We are all very grateful to General Schwarzkopf and to all those serving with him And might also recognize one who came with Mrs Schwarzkopf Alma Powell wife of distinguished Chairman of Joint Chiefs And to families let me say our forces in Gulf will not stay there one day longer than is necessary to complete their mission The courage and success of RAF pilots of Kuwaiti Saudi French Canadians Italians pilots of Qatar and Bahrain -- all are proof that for first time since World War I international community is united The leadership of United Nations once only a hoped-for ideal is now confirming its founders' vision am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone financial burdens of this struggle Last year our friends and allies provided bulk of economic costs of Desert Shield And now having received commitments of over $40 billion for first three months of 1991 am confident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm But world has to wonder what dictator of Iraq is thinking If he thinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia that he will gain advantage he is dead wrong If he thinks that he will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental terrorism he is dead wrong And if he thinks that by abusing coalition prisoners of war he will benef he is dead wrong We will succeed in Gulf And when we do world community will have sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot present or future who contemplates outlaw aggression The world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill long-held promise of a new world order where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance Yes United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort Among nations of world only United States of America has both moral standing and means to back up We're only nation on this Earth that could assemble forces of peace This is burden of leadership and strength that has made America beacon of freedom in a searching world This nation has never found glory in war Our people have never wanted to abandon blessings of home and work for distant lands and deadly conflict If we fight in anger is only because we have to fight at all And all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again Each of us will measure within ourselves value of this great struggle Any cost in lives -- any cost -- is beyond our power to measure But cost of closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to imagine This we do know Our cause is just; our cause is moral; our cause is right Let future generations understand burden and blessings of freedom Let them say we stood where duty required us to stand Let them know that together we affirmed America and world as a community of conscience The winds of change are with us now The forces of freedom are together united We move toward next century more confident than ever that we have will at home and abroad to do what must be done -- hard work of freedom May God bless United States of America very very much\"

american, people, with, an, appeal, for, renewal, this, is, not, merely, a, call, for, new, government, initiatives;, is, a, call, for, new, initiatives, in, government, in, our, communities, and, from, every, american, to, prepare, for, next, american, century, america, has, always, led, by, example, so, who, among, us, will, set, example?, which, of, our, citizens, will, lead, us, in, this, next, american, century?, everyone, who, steps, forward, today, --, to, get, one, addict, off, drugs, to, convince, one, troubled, teenager, not, to, give, up, on, life, to, comfort, one, aids,

shining, purpose, illumination, of, a, thousand, points, of, light, and, is, expressed, by, all, who, know, irresistible, force, of, a, child's, hand, of, a, friend, who, stands, by, you, and, stays, there, a, volunteer's, generous, gesture, an, idea, that, is, simply, right, the, problems, before, us, may, be, different, but, key, to, solving, them, remains, same, it, is, individual, --, individual, who, steps, forward, and, state, of, our, union, is, union, of, each, of, us, one, to, other, --, sum, of, our, friendships, marriages, families, and, communities, we, all, have,

who, is, join, community, of, conscience, do, hard, work, of, freedom, and, that, will, define, state, of, our, union, since, birth, of, our, nation, \"\"we, people\"\", has, been, source, of, our, strength, what, government, can, do, alone, is, limited, but, potential, of, american, people, knows, no, limits, we, are, a, nation, of, rock-solid, realism, and, clear-eyed, idealism, we, are, americans, we, are, nation, that, believes, in, future, we, are, nation, that, can, shape, future, and, we've, begun, to, do, just, that, by, strengthening, power, and, choice, of, individuals, and, families, together, these, last, two, years, we've, put, dollars, for, child, care, directly, in, hands, of, parents, instead, of, bureaucracies;, unshackled, potential, of, americans, with, disabilities;, applied, creativity, of, marketplace, in, service, of, environment, for, clean, air;, and, made, home, ownership, possible, for, more, americans, the, strength, of, a, democracy, is, not, in, bureaucracy, it, is, in, people, and, their, communities, in, everything, we, do, let, us, unleash, potential, of, our, most, precious, resource, --, our, citizens, our, citizens, themselves, we, must, return, to, families, communities, counties, cities, states, and, institutions, of, every, kind, power, to, chart, their, own, destiny, and, freedom, and, opportunity, provided, by, strong, economic, growth, and, that's, what, america, is, all, about, know, that, tonight, in, some, regions, of, our, country, people, are, in, genuine, economic, distress, and, hear, them, earlier, this, month, kathy, blackwell, of, massachusetts, wrote, me, about, what, can, happen, when, economy, slows, down, saying, \"\"my, heart, is, aching, and, think, that, you, should, know, your, people, out, here, are, hurting, badly, \"\", understand, and, i'm, not, unrealistic, about, future, but, there, are, reasons, to, be, optimistic, about, our, economy, first, we, don't, have, to, fight, double-diginflation, second, most, industries, won't, have, to, make, big, cuts, in, production, because, they, don't, have, big, inventories, piled, up, and, third, our, exports, are, running, solid, and, strong, in, fact, american, businesses, are, exporting, at, a, record, rate, so, let's, put, these, times, in, perspective, together, since, 1981, we've, created, almost, 20, million, jobs, cut, inflation, in, half, and, cut, interest, rates, in, half, and, yes, largest, peacetime, economic, expansion, in, history, has, been, temporarily, interrupted, but, our, economy, is, still, over, twice, as, large, as, our, closest, competitor, we, will, get, this, recession, behind, us, and, return, to, growth, soon, we, will, get, on, our, way, to, a, new, record, of, expansion, and, achieve, competitive, strength, that, will, carry, us, into, next, american, century, we, should, focus, our, efforts, today, on, encouraging, economic, growth, investing, in, future, and, giving, power, and, opportunity, to, individual, we, must, begin, with, control, of, federal, spending, that's, why, i'm, submitting, a, budget, that, holds, growth, in, spending, to, less, than, rate, of, inflation, and, that's, why, amid, all, sound, and, fury, of, last, year's, budget, debate, we, put, into, law, new, enforceable, spending, caps, so, that, future, spending, debates, will, mean, a, battle, of, ideas, not, a, bidding, war, though, controversial, budget, agreement, finally, put, federal, government, on, a, pay-as-you-go, plan, and, cut, growth, of, debt, by, nearly, $500, billion, and, that, frees, funds, for, saving, and, job-creating, investment, now, let's, do, more, my, budget, again, includes, tax-free, family, savings, accounts;, penalty-free, withdrawals, from, iras, for, first-time, home, buyers;, and, to, increase, jobs, and, growth, a, reduced, tax, for, long-term, capital, gains, know, there, are, differences, among, us, --, laughter, --, about, impact, and, effects, of, a, capital, gains, incentive, so, tonight, i'm, asking, congressional, leaders, and, federal, reserve, to, cooperate, with, us, in, a, study, led, by, chairman, alan, greenspan, to, sort, out, our, technical, differences, so, that, we, can, avoid, a, return, to, unproductive, partisan, bickering, but, just, as, our, efforts, will, bring, economic, growth, now, and, in, future, they, must, also, be, matched, by, long-term, investments, for, next, american, century, that, requires, a, forward-looking, plan, of, action, and, that's, exactly, what, we, will, be, sending, to, congress, we've, prepared, a, detailed, series, of, proposals, that, include, a, budget, that, promotes, investment, in, america's, future, --, in, children, education, infrastructure, space, and, high, technology;, legislation, to, achieve, excellence, in, education, building, on, partnership, forged, with, 50, governors, at, education, summ, enabling, parents, to, choose, their, children's, schools, and, helping, to, make, america, number, one, in, math, and, science;, a, blueprint, for, a, new, national, highway, system, a, critical, investment, in, our, transportation, infrastructure;, a, research, and, development, agenda, that, includes, record, levels, of, federal, investment, and, a, permanent, tax, credto, strengthen, private, r, and, d, and, to, create, jobs;, a, comprehensive, national, energy, strategy, that, calls, for, energy, conservation, and, efficiency, increased, development, and, greater, use, of, alternative, fuels;, a, banking, reform, plan, to, bring, america's, financial, system, into, 21st, century, so, that, our, banks, remain, safe, and, secure, and, can, continue, to, make, job-creating, loans, for, our, factories, our, businesses, and, home, buyers, you, know, do, think, there, has, been, too, much, pessimism, sound, banks, should, be, making, sound, loans, now, and, interest, rates, should, be, lower, now, in, addition, to, these, proposals, we, must, recognize, that, our, economic, strength, depends, on, being, competitive, in, world, markets, we, must, continue, to, expand, american, exports, a, successful, uruguay, round, of, world, trade, negotiations, will, create, more, real, jobs, and, more, real, growth, for, all, nations, you, and, know, that, if, playing, field, is, level, america's, workers, and, farmers, can, out-work, out-produce, anyone, anytime, anywhere, and, with, a, mexican, free, trade, agreement, and, our, enterprise, for, americas, initiative, we, can, help, our, partners, strengthen, their, economies, and, move, toward, a, free, trade, zone, throughout, this, entire, hemisphere, the, budget, also, includes, a, plan, of, action, right, here, at, home, to, put, more, power, and, opportunity, in, hands, of, individual, and, that, means, new, incentives, to, create, jobs, in, our, inner, cities, by, encouraging, investment, through, enterprise, zones, it, also, means, tenant, control, and, ownership, of, public, housing, freedom, and, power, to, choose, should, not, be, privilege, of, wealth, they, are, birthright, of, every, american, civil, rights, are, also, crucial, to, protecting, equal, opportunity, every, one, of, us, has, a, responsibility, to, speak, out, against, racism, bigotry, and, hate, we, will, continue, our, vigorous, enforcement, of, existing, statutes, and, will, once, again, press, congress, to, strengthen, laws, against, employment, discrimination, without, resorting, to, use, of, unfair, preferences, we're, determined, to, protect, another, fundamental, civil, right, freedom, from, crime, and, fear, that, stalks, our, cities, the, attorney, general, will, soon, convene, a, crime, summof, our, nation's, law, enforcement, officials, and, to, help, us, support, them, we, need, tough, crime, control, legislation, and, we, need, now, and, as, we, fight, crime, we, will, fully, implement, our, national, strategy, for, combating, drug, abuse, recent, data, show, that, we, are, making, progress, but, much, remains, to, be, done, we, will, not, rest, until, day, of, dealer, is, over, forever, good, health, care, is, every, american's, right, and, every, american's, responsibility, and, so, we, are, proposing, an, aggressive, program, of, new, prevention, initiatives, --, for, infants, for, children, for, adults, and, for, elderly, --, to, promote, a, healthier, america, and, to, help, keep, costs, from, spiraling, it's, time, to, give, people, more, choice, in, government, by, reviving, ideal, of, citizen, politician, who, comes, not, to, stay, but, to, serve, and, one, of, reasons, that, there, is, so, much, support, across, this, country, for, term, limitations, is, that, american, people, are, increasingly, concerned, about, big-money, influence, in, politics, so, we, must, look, beyond, next, election, to, next, generation, and, time, has, come, to, put, national, interest, above, special, interest, and, to, totally, eliminate, political, action, committees, and, that, would, truly, put, more, competition, in, elections, and, more, power, in, hands, of, individuals, and, where, power, cannot, be, put, directly, in, hands, of, individual, should, be, moved, closer, to, people, away, from, washington, the, federal, government, too, often, treats, government, programs, as, if, they, are, of, washington, by, washington, and, for, washington, once, established, federal, programs, seem, to, become, immortal, it's, time, for, a, more, dynamic, program, life, cycle, some, programs, should, increase, some, should, decrease, some, should, be, terminated, and, some, should, be, consolidated, and, turned, over, to, states, my, budget, includes, a, list, of, programs, for, potential, turnover, totaling, more, than, $20, billion, working, with, congress, and, governors, propose, we, select, at, least, $15, billion, in, such, programs, and, turn, them, over, to, states, in, a, single, consolidated, grant, fully, funded, for, flexible, management, by, states, the, value, value, of, this, turnover, approach, is, straightforward, it, allows, federal, government, to, reduce, overhead, it, allows, states, to, manage, more, flexibly, and, more, efficiently, it, moves, power, and, decisionmaking, closer, to, people, and, reinforces, a, theme, of, this, administration, appreciation, and, encouragement, of, innovative, powers, of, states, as, laboratories, this, nation, was, founded, by, leaders, who, understood, that, power, belongs, in, hands, of, people, and, they, planned, for, future, and, so, must, we, here, and, all, around, world, as, americans, we, know, that, there, are, times, when, we, must, step, forward, and, accept, our, responsibility, to, lead, world, away, from, dark, chaos, of, dictators, toward, brighter, promise, of, a, better, day, almost, 50, years, ago, we, began, a, long, struggle, against, aggressive, totalitarianism, now, we, face, another, defining, hour, for, america, and, world, there, is, no, one, more, devoted, more, committed, to, hard, work, of, freedom, than, every, soldier, and, sailor, every, marine, airman, and, coastguardsman, every, man, and, woman, now, serving, in, persian, gulf, oh, how, they, deserve, --, applause, --, and, what, a, fitting, tribute, to, them, you, see, --, what, a, wonderful, fitting, tribute, to, them, each, of, them, has, volunteered, volunteered, to, provide, for, this, nation's, defense, and, now, they, bravely, struggle, to, earn, for, america, for, world, and, for, future, generations, a, just, and, lasting, peace, our, commitment, to, them, must, be, equal, to, their, commitment, to, their, country, they, are, truly, america's, finest, the, war, in, gulf, is, not, a, war, we, wanted, we, worked, hard, to, avoid, war, for, more, than, five, months, we, --, along, with, arab, league, european, community, united, nations, --, tried, every, diplomatic, avenue, u, n, secretary-general, perez, de, cuellar;, presidents, gorbachev, mitterrand, ozal, mubarak, and, bendjedid;, kings, fahd, and, hassan;, prime, ministers, major, and, andreotti, --, just, to, name, a, few, --, all, worked, for, a, solution, but, time, and, again, saddam, hussein, flatly, rejected, path, of, diplomacy, and, peace, the, world, well, knows, how, this, conflict, began, and, when, it, began, on, august, 2nd, when, saddam, invaded, and, sacked, a, small, defenseless, neighbor, and, am, certain, of, how, will, end, so, that, peace, can, prevail, we, will, prevail, applause, tonight, am, pleased, to, report, that, we, are, on, course, iraq's, capacity, to, sustain, war, is, being, destroyed, our, investment, our, training, our, planning, --, all, are, paying, off, time, will, not, be, saddam's, salvation, our, purpose, in, persian, gulf, remains, constant, to, drive, iraq, out, of, kuwa, to, restore, kuwait's, legitimate, government, and, to, ensure, stability, and, security, of, this, critical, region, let, me, make, clear, what, mean, by, region's, stability, and, security, we, do, not, seek, destruction, of, iraq, its, culture, or, its, people, rather, we, seek, an, iraq, that, uses, its, great, resources, not, to, destroy, not, to, serve, ambitions, of, a, tyrant, but, to, build, a, better, life, for, itself, and, its, neighbors, we, seek, a, persian, gulf, where, conflict, is, no, longer, rule, where, strong, are, neither, tempted, nor, able, to, intimidate, weak, most, americans, know, instinctively, why, we, are, in, gulf, they, know, we, had, to, stop, saddam, now, not, later, they, know, that, this, brutal, dictator, will, do, anything, will, use, any, weapon, will, commany, outrage, no, matter, how, many, innocents, suffer, they, know, we, must, make, sure, that, control, of, world's, oil, resources, does, not, fall, into, his, hands, only, to, finance, further, aggression, they, know, that, we, need, to, build, a, new, enduring, peace, based, not, on, arms, races, and, confrontation, but, on, shared, principles, and, rule, of, law, and, we, all, realize, that, our, responsibility, to, be, catalyst, for, peace, in, region, does, not, end, with, successful, conclusion, of, this, war, democracy, brings, undeniable, value, of, thoughtful, dissent, and, we've, heard, some, dissenting, voices, here, at, home, --, some, a, handful, reckless;, most, responsible, but, fact, that, all, voices, have, right, to, speak, out, is, one, of, reasons, we've, been, united, in, purpose, and, principle, for, 200, years, our, progress, in, this, great, struggle, is, result, of, years, of, vigilance, and, a, steadfast, commitment, to, a, strong, defense, now, with, remarkable, technological, advances, like, patriot, missile, we, can, defend, against, ballistic, missile, attacks, aimed, at, innocent, civilians, looking, forward, have, directed, that, sd, program, be, refocused, on, providing, protection, from, limited, ballistic, missile, strikes, whatever, their, source, let, us, pursue, an, sd, program, that, can, deal, with, any, future, threat, to, united, states, to, our, forces, overseas, and, to, our, friends, and,

life, we, have, given, our, men, and, women, very, best, and, they, deserve, we, all, have, a, special, place, in, our, hearts, for, families, of, our, men, and, women, serving, in, gulf, they, are, represented, here, tonight, by, mrs, norman, schwarzkopf, we, are, all, very, grateful, to, general, schwarzkopf, and, to, all, those, serving, with, him, and, might, also, recognize, one, who, came, with, mrs, schwarzkopf, alma, powell, wife, of, distinguished, chairman, of, joint, chiefs, and, to, families, let, me, say, our, forces, in, gulf, will, not, stay, there, one, day, longer, than, is, necessary, to, complete, their, mission, the, courage, and, success, of, raf, pilots, of, kuwaiti, saudi, french, canadians, italians, pilots, of, qatar, and, bahrain, --, all, are, proof, that, for, first, time, since, world, war, i, international, community, is, united, the, leadership, of, united, nations, once, only, a, hoped-for, ideal, is, now, confirming, its, founders', vision, am, heartened, that, we, are, not, being, asked, to, bear, alone, financial, burdens, of, this, struggle, last, year, our, friends, and, allies, provided, bulk, of, economic, costs, of, desert, shield, and, now, having, received, commitments, of, over, $40, billion, for, first, three, months, of, 1991, am, confident, they, will, do, no, less, as, we, move, through, desert, storm, but, world, has, to, wonder, what, dictator, of, iraq, is, thinking, if, he, thinks, that, by, targeting, innocent, civilians, in, israel, and, saudi, arabia, that, he, will, gain, advantage, he, is, dead, wrong, if, he, thinks, that, he, will, advance, his, cause, through, tragic, and, despicable, environmental, terrorism, he, is, dead, wrong, and, if, he, thinks, that, by, abusing, coalition, prisoners, of, war, he, will, benef, he, is, dead, wrong, we, will, succeed, in, gulf, and, when, we, do, world, community, will, have, sent, an, enduring, warning, to, any, dictator, or, despot, present, or, future, who, contemplates, outlaw, aggression, the, world, can, therefore, seize, this, opportunity, to, fulfill, long-held, promise, of, a, new, world, order, where, brutality, will, go, unrewarded, and, aggression, will, meet, collective, resistance, yes, united, states, bears, a, major, share, of, leadership, in, this, effort, among, nations, of, world, only, united, states, of, america, has, both, moral, standing, and, means, to, back, up, we're, only, nation, on, this, earth, that, could, assemble, forces, of, peace, this, is, burden, of, leadership, and, strength, that, has, made, america, beacon, of, freedom, in, a, searching, world, this, nation, has, never, found, glory, in, war, our, people, have, never, wanted, to, abandon, blessings, of, home, and, work, for, distant, lands, and, deadly, conflict, if, we, fight, in, anger, is, only, because, we, have, to, fight, at, all, and, all, of, us, yearn, for, a, world, where, we, will, never, have, to, fight, again, each, of, us, will, measure, within, ourselves, value, of, this, great, struggle, any, cost, in, lives, --, any, cost, --, is, beyond, our, power, to, measure, but, cost, of, closing, our, eyes, to, aggression, is, beyond, mankind's, power, to, imagine, this, we, do, know, our, cause, is, just;, our, cause, is, moral;, our, cause, is, right, let, future, generations, understand, burden, and, blessings, of, freedom, let, them, say, we, stood, where, duty, required, us, to, stand, let, them, know, that, together, we, affirmed, america, and, world, as, a, community, of, conscience, the, winds, of, change, are, with, us, now, the, forces, of, freedom, are, together, united, we, move, toward, next, century, more, confident, than, ever, that, we, have, will, at, home, and, abroad, to, do, what, must, be,

their joy a joy tempered only by our compassion for their ordeal Tonight Kuwaiti flag once again flies above capital of a free and sovereign nation And American flag flies above our Embassy Seven months ago America and world drew a line in sand We declared that aggression against Kuwawould not stand And tonight America and world have kept their word This is not a time of euphoria certainly not a time to gloat But is a time of pride pride in our troops; pride in friends who stood with us in crisis; pride in our nation and people whose strength and resolve made victory quick decisive and just And soon we will open wide our arms to welcome back home to America our magnificent fighting forces No one country can claim this victory as its own It was not only a victory for Kuwabut a victory for all coalition partners This is a victory for United Nations for all mankind for rule of law and for what is right After consulting with Secretary of Defense Cheney Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff General Powell and our coalition partners am pleased to announce that at midnight tonight eastern standard time exactly 100 hours since ground operations commenced and 6 weeks since start of Desert Storm all United States and coalition forces will suspend offensive combat operations It is up to Iraq whether this suspension on part of coalition becomes a permanent cease-fire Coalition political and military terms for a formal cease-fire include following requirements Iraq must release immediately all coalition prisoners of war third country nationals and remains of all who have fallen Iraq must release all Kuwaiti detainees Iraq also must inform Kuwaiti authorities of location and nature of all land and sea mines Iraq must comply fully with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions This includes a rescinding of Iraq's August decision to annex Kuwaand acceptance in principle of Iraq's responsibility to pay compensation for loss damage and injury its aggression has caused The coalition calls upon Iraqi Government to designate military commanders to meet within 48 hours with their coalition counterparts at a place in theater of operations to be specified to arrange for military aspects of cease-fire Further have asked Secretary of State Baker to request that United Nations Security Council meet to formulate necessary arrangements for this war to be ended This suspension of offensive combat operations is contingent upon Iraq's not firing upon any coalition forces and not launching Scud missiles against any other country If Iraq violates these terms coalition forces will be free to resume military operations At every opportunity have said to people of Iraq that our quarrel was not with them but instead with their leadership and above all with Saddam Hussein This remains case You people of Iraq are not our enemy We do not seek your destruction We have treated your POW's with kindness Coalition forces fought this war only as a last resort and look forward to day when Iraq is led by people prepared to live in peace with their neighbors We must now begin to look beyond victory and war We must meet challenge of securing peace In future as before we will consult with our coalition partners We've already done a good deal of thinking and planning for postwar period and Secretary Baker has already begun to consult with our coalition partners on region's challenges There can be and will be no solely American answer to all these challenges But we can assist and support countries of region and be a catalyst for peace In this spir Secretary Baker will go to region next week to begin a new round of consultations This war is now behind us Ahead of us is difficult task of securing a potentially historic peace Tonight though let us be proud of what we have accomplished Let us give thanks to those who risked their lives Let us never forget those who gave their lives May God bless our valiant military forces and their families and let us all remember them in our prayers Good night and may God bless United States of America

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"And sir for those very generous words spoken from heart about wonderful performance of our military Members of Congress 5 short weeks ago came to this House to speak to you about state of Union We met then in time of war Tonight we meet in a world blessed by promise of peace From moment Operation Desert Storm commenced on January 16th until time guns fell silent at midnight 1 week ago this nation has watched its sons and daughters with pride watched over them with prayer As Commander in Chief can report to you our armed forces fought with honor and valor And as can report to Nation aggression is defeated The war is over This is a victory for every country in coalition for United Nations A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy so well led by our Secretary of State James Baker It is a victory for rule of law and for what is right Desert Storm's success belongs to team that so ably leads our Armed Forces our Secretary of Defense and our Chairman of Joint Chiefs Dick Cheney and Colin Powell And while you're standing -- laughter -- this military victory also belongs to one British call \"\"Man of Match\"\" -- tower of calm at eye of Desert Storm -- General Norman Schwarzkopf And recognizing this was a coalition effort let us not forget Saudi General Khalid Britain's General de la Billiere or General Roquejeoffre of France and all others whose leadership played such a vital role And most importantly most importantly of all all those who served in field thank Members of this Congress -- support here for our troops in battle was overwhelming And above all thank those whose unfailing love and support sustained our courageous men and women thank American people Tonight come to this House to speak about world -- world after war The recent challenge could not have been clearer Saddam Hussein was villain; Kuwa victim To aid of this small country came nations from North America and Europe from Asia and South America from Africa and Arab world all united against aggression Our uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose to forge a future that should never again be held hostage to darker side of human nature Tonight in Iraq Saddam walks amidst ruin His war machine is crushed His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed His people have been lied to denied truth And when his defeated legions come home all Iraqis will see and feel havoc he has wrought And this promise you For all that Saddam has done to his own people to Kuwaitis and to entire world Saddam and those around him are accountable All of us grieve for victims of war for people of Kuwaand suffering that scars soul of that proud nation We grieve for all our fallen soldiers and their families for all innocents caught up in this conflict And yes we grieve for people of Iraq a people who have never been our enemy My hope is that one day we will once again welcome them as friends into community of nations Our commitment to peace in Middle East does not end with liberation of Kuwa So tonight let me outline four key challenges to be met First we must work together to create shared security arrangements in region Our friends and allies in Middle East recognize that they will bear bulk of responsibility for regional security But we want them to know that just as we stood with them to repel aggression so now America stands ready to work with them to secure peace This does not mean stationing U S ground forces in Arabian Peninsula but does mean American participation in joint exercises involving both air and ground forces It means maintaining a capable U S naval presence in region just as we have for over 40 years Let be clear Our vital national interests depend on a stable and secure Gulf Second we must act to control proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles used to deliver them It would be tragic if nations of Middle East and Persian Gulf were now in wake of war to embark on a new arms race Iraq requires special vigilance Until Iraq convinces world of its peaceful intentions -- that its leaders will not use new revenues to rearm and rebuild its menacing war machine -- Iraq must not have access to instruments of war And third we must work to create new opportunities for peace and stability in Middle East On night announced Operation Desert Storm expressed my hope that out of horrors of war might come new momentum for peace We've learned in modern age geography cannot guarantee security and security does not come from military power alone All of us know depth of bitterness that has made dispute between Israel and its neighbors so painful and intractable Yet in conflict just concluded Israel and many of Arab States have for first time found themselves confronting same aggressor By now should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in Middle East requires compromise At same time peace brings real benefits to everyone We must do all that we can to close gap between Israel and Arab States -- and between Israelis and Palestinians The tactics of terror lead absolutely nowhere There can be no substitute for diplomacy A comprehensive peace must be grounded in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and principle of territory for peace This principle must be elaborated to provide for Israel's security and recognition and at same time for legitimate Palestinian political rights Anything else would fail twin test of fairness and security The time has come to put an end to Arab-Israeli conflict The war with Iraq is over The quest for solutions to problems in Lebanon in Arab-Israeli dispute and in Gulf must go forward with new vigor and determination And guarantee you No one will work harder for a stable peace in region than we will Fourth we must foster economic development for sake of peace and progress The Persian Gulf and Middle East form a region rich in natural resources with a wealth of untapped human potential Resources once squandered on military might must be redirected to more peaceful ends We are already addressing immediate economic consequences of Iraq's aggression Now challenge is to reach higher to foster economic freedom and prosperity for all people of region By meeting these four challenges we can build a framework for peace I've asked Secretary of State Baker to go to Middle East to begin process He will go to listen to probe to offer suggestions -- to advance search for peace and stability I've also asked him to raise plight of hostages held in Lebanon We have not forgotten them and we will not forget them To all challenges that confront this region of world there is no single solution no solely American answer But we can make a difference America will work tirelessly as a catalyst for positive change But we cannot lead a new world abroad if at home it's politics as usual on American defense and diplomacy It's time to turn away from temptation to protect unneeded weapons systems and obsolete bases It's time to put an end to micromanagement of foreign and security assistance programs -- micromanagement that humiliates our friends and allies and hamstrings our diplomacy It's time to rise above parochial and pork barrel to do what is necessary what's right and what will enable this nation to play leadership role required of us The consequences of conflict in Gulf reach far beyond confines of Middle East Twice before in this century an entire world was convulsed by war Twice this century out of horrors of war hope emerged for enduring peace Twice before those hopes proved to be a distant dream beyond grasp of man Until now world we've known has been a world divided -- a world of barbed wire and concrete block conflict and cold war Now we can see a new world coming into view A world in which there is very real prospect of a new world order In words of Winston Churchill a world order in which \"\" principles of justice and fair play protect weak against strong \"\" A world where United Nations freed from cold war stalemate is poised to fulfill historic vision of its founders A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations The Gulf war put this new world to its first test And my fellow Americans we passed that test For sake of our principles for sake of Kuwaiti people we stood our ground Because world would not look other way Ambassador al-Sabah tonight Kuwais free And we're very happy about that Tonight as our troops begin to come home let us recognize that hard work of freedom still calls us forward We've learned hard lessons of history The victory over Iraq was not waged as \"\"a war to end all wars \"\" Even new world order cannot guarantee an era of perpetual peace But enduring peace must be our mission Our success in Gulf will shape not only new world order we seek but our mission here at home In war just ended there were clear-cut objectives -- timetables -- and above all an overriding imperative to achieve results We must bring that same sense of self-discipline that same sense of urgency to way we meet challenges here at home In my State of Union Address and in my budget defined a comprehensive agenda to prepare for next American century Our first priority is to get this economy rolling again The fear and uncertainty caused by Gulf crisis were understandable But now that war is over oil prices are down interest rates are down and confidence is rightly coming back Americans can move forward to lend spend and invest in this strongest economy on Earth We must also enact legislation that is key to building a better America For example in 1990 we enacted an historic Clean Air Act And now we've proposed a national energy strategy We passed a child-care bill that put power in hands of parents And today we're ready to do same thing with our schools and expand choice in education We passed a crime bill that made a useful start in fighting crime and drugs This year we're sending to Congress our comprehensive crime package to finish job We passed landmark Americans with Disabilities Act And now we've sent forward our civil rights bill We also passed aviation bill This year we've sent up our new highway bill And these are just a few of our pending proposals for reform and renewal So tonight call on Congress to move forward aggressively on our domestic front Let's begin with two initiatives we should be able to agree on quickly transportation and crime And then let's build on success with those and enact rest of our agenda If our forces could win ground war in 100 hours then surely Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days Let that be a promise we make tonight to American people When spoke in this House about state of our Union asked all of you If we can selflessly confront evil for sake of good in a land so far away then surely we can make this land all that should be In time since then brave men and women of Desert Storm accomplished more than even they may realize They set out to confront an enemy abroad and in process they transformed a nation at home Think of way they went about their mission -- with confidence and quiet pride Think about their sense of duty about all they taught us about our values about ourselves We hear so often about our young people in turmoil -- how our children fall short how our schools fail us how American products and American workers are second-class Well don't you believe The America we saw in Desert Storm was first-class talent And they did using America's state-of-the-art technology We saw excellence embodied in Patriot missile and patriots who made work And we saw soldiers who know about honor and bravery and duty and country and world-shaking power of these simple words There is something noble and majestic about pride about patriotism that we feel tonight So to everyone here and everyone watching at home think about men and women of Desert Storm Let us honor them with our gratitude Let us comfort families of fallen and remember each precious life lost Let us learn from them as well Let us honor those who have served us by serving others Let us honor them as individuals -- men and women of every race all creeds and colors -- by setting face of this nation against discrimination bigotry and hate Eliminate them I'm sure that many of you saw on television unforgettable scene of four terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering They emerged from their bunker broken tears streaming from their eyes fearing worst And then there was an American soldier Remember what he said? He said \"\"It's okay You're all right now You're all right now \"\" That scene says a lot about America a lot about who we are Americans are a caring people We are a good people a generous people Let us always be caring and good and generous in all we do Soon very soon our troops will begin march we've all been waiting for -- their march home And have directed Secretary Cheney to begin immediate return of American combat units from Gulf Less than 2 hours from now first planeload of American soldiers will lift off from Saudi Arabia headed for U S A That plane will carry men and women of 24th Mechanized Infantry Division bound for Fort Stewart Georgia This is just beginning of a steady flow of American troops coming home Let their return remind us that all those who have gone before are linked with us in long line of freedom's march Americans have always tried to serve to sacrifice nobly for what we believe to be right Tonight ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops They may have missed Thanksgiving and Christmas but can tell you this For them and for their families we can make this a holiday they'll never forget In a very real sense this victory belongs to them -- to privates and pilots to sergeants and supply officers to men and women in machines and men and women who made them work It belongs to regulars to reserves to National Guard This victory belongs to finest fighting force this nation has ever known in its history We went halfway around world to do what is moral and just and right We fought hard and with others we won war We lifted yoke of aggression and tyranny from a small country that many Americans had never even heard of and we ask nothing in return We're coming home now -- proud confident heads high There is much that we must do at home and abroad And we will do We are Americans May God bless this great nation United States of America all very very much\"

and, most, importantly, most, importantly, of, all, all, those, who, served, in, field, thank, members, of, this, congress, --, support, here, for, our, troops, in, battle, was, overwhelming, and,

world, after, war, the, recent, challenge, could, not, have, been, clearer, saddam, hussein, was, villain;, kuwa, victim, to, aid, of, this, small, country, came, nations, from, north, america, and, europe, from, asia, and, south, america, from, africa, and, arab, world, all, united, against, aggression, our, uncommon, coalition, must, now, work, in, common, purpose, to, forge, a, future, that, should, never, again, be, held, hostage, to, darker, side, of, human, nature, tonight, in, iraq, saddam, walks, amidst, ruin, his, war, machine, is, crushed, his, ability, to, threaten, mass,

this, promise, you, for, all, that, saddam, has, done, to, his, own, people, to, kuwaitis, and, to, entire, world, saddam, and, those, around, him, are, accountable, all, of, us, grieve, for, victims, of, war, for, people, of, kuwaand, suffering, that, scars, soul, of, that, proud, nation, we, grieve, for, all, our, fallen, soldiers, and, their, families, for, all, innocents, caught, up, in, this, conflict, and, yes, we, grieve, for, people, of, iraq, a, people, who, have, never, been, our, enemy, my, hope, is, that, one, day, we, will, once, again, welcome, them, as, friends, into, community, of, nations, our, commitment, to, peace, in, middle, east, does, not, end, with, liberation, of, kuwa, so, tonight, let, me, outline, four, key, challenges, to, be, met, first, we, must, work, together, to, create, shared, security, arrangements, in, region, our, friends, and, allies, in, middle, east, recognize, that, they, will, bear, bulk, of, responsibility, for, regional, security, but, we, want, them, to, know, that, just, as, we, stood, with, them, to, repel, aggression, so, now, america, stands, ready, to, work, with, them, to, secure, peace, this, does, not, mean, stationing, u, s, ground, forces, in, arabian, peninsula, but, does, mean, american, participation, in, joint, exercises, involving, both, air, and, ground, forces, it, means, maintaining, a, capable, u, s, naval, presence, in, region, just, as, we, have, for, over, 40, years, let, be, clear, our, vital, national, interests, depend, on, a, stable, and, secure, gulf, second, we, must, act, to, control, proliferation, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, missiles, used, to, deliver, them, it, would, be, tragic, if, nations, of, middle, east, and, persian, gulf, were, now, in, wake, of, war, to, embark, on, a, new, arms, race, iraq, requires, special, vigilance, until, iraq, convinces, world, of, its, peaceful, intentions, --, that, its, leaders, will, not, use, new, revenues, to, rearm, and, rebuild, its, menacing, war, machine, --, iraq, must, not, have, access, to, instruments, of, war, and, third, we, must, work, to, create, new, opportunities, for, peace, and, stability, in, middle, east, on, night, announced, operation, desert, storm, expressed, my, hope, that, out, of, horrors, of, war, might, come, new, momentum, for, peace, we've, learned, in, modern, age, geography, cannot, guarantee, security, and, security, does, not, come, from, military, power, alone, all, of, us, know, depth, of, bitterness, that, has, made, dispute, between, israel, and, its, neighbors, so, painful, and, intractable, yet, in, conflict, just, concluded, israel, and, many, of, arab, states, have, for, first, time, found, themselves, confronting, same, aggressor, by, now, should, be, plain, to, all, parties, that, peacemaking, in, middle, east, requires, compromise, at, same, time, peace, brings, real, benefits, to, everyone, we, must, do, all, that, we, can, to, close, gap, between, israel, and, arab, states, --, and, between, israelis, and, palestinians, the, tactics, of, terror, lead, absolutely, nowhere, there, can, be, no, substitute, for, diplomacy, a, comprehensive, peace, must, be, grounded, in, united, nations, security, council, resolutions, 242, and, 338, and, principle, of, territory, for, peace, this, principle, must, be, elaborated, to, provide, for, israel's, security, and, recognition, and, at, same, time, for, legitimate, palestinian, political, rights, anything, else, would, fail, twin, test, of, fairness, and, security, the, time, has, come, to, put, an, end, to, arab-israeli, conflict, the, war, with, iraq, is, over, the, quest, for, solutions, to, problems, in, lebanon, in, arab-israeli, dispute, and, in, gulf, must, go, forward, with, new, vigor, and, determination, and, guarantee, you, no, one, will, work, harder, for, a, stable, peace, in, region, than, we, will, fourth, we, must, foster, economic, development, for, sake, of, peace, and, progress, the, persian, gulf, and, middle, east, form, a, region, rich, in, natural, resources, with, a, wealth, of, untapped, human, potential, resources, once, squandered, on, military, might, must, be, redirected, to, more, peaceful, ends, we, are, already, addressing, immediate, economic, consequences, of, iraq's, aggression, now, challenge, is, to, reach, higher, to, foster, economic, freedom, and, prosperity, for, all, people, of, region, by, meeting, these, four, challenges, we, can, build, a, framework, for, peace, i've, asked, secretary, of, state, baker, to, go, to, middle, east, to, begin, process, he, will, go, to, listen, to, probe, to, offer, suggestions, --, to, advance, search, for, peace, and, stability, i've, also, asked, him, to, raise, plight, of, hostages, held, in, lebanon, we, have, not, forgotten, them, and, we, will, not, forget, them, to, all, challenges, that, confront, this, region, of, world, there, is, no, single, solution, no, solely, american, answer, but, we, can, make, a, difference, america, will, work, tirelessly, as, a, catalyst, for, positive, change, but, we, cannot, lead, a, new, world, abroad, if, at, home, it's, politics, as, usual, on, american, defense, and, diplomacy, it's, time, to, turn, away, from, temptation, to, protect, unneeded, weapons, systems, and, obsolete, bases, it's, time, to, put, an, end, to, micromanagement, of, foreign, and, security, assistance, programs, --, micromanagement, that, humiliates, our, friends, and, allies, and, hamstrings, our, diplomacy, it's, time, to, rise, above, parochial, and, pork, barrel, to, do, what, is, necessary, what's, right, and, what, will, enable, this, nation, to, play, leadership, role, required, of, us, the, consequences, of, conflict, in, gulf, reach, far, beyond, confines, of, middle, east, twice, before, in, this, century, an, entire, world, was, convulsed, by, war, twice, this, century, out, of, horrors, of, war, hope, emerged, for, enduring, peace, twice, before, those, hopes, proved, to, be, a, distant, dream, beyond, grasp, of, man, until, now, world, we've, known, has, been, a, world, divided, --, a, world, of, barbed, wire, and, concrete, block, conflict, and, cold, war, now, we, can, see, a, new, world, coming, into, view, a, world, in, which, there, is, very, real, prospect, of, a, new, world, order, in, words, of, winston, churchill, a, world, order, in, which, \"\", principles, of, justice, and, fair, play, protect, weak, against, strong, \"\", a, world, where, united, nations, freed, from, cold, war, stalemate, is, poised, to, fulfill, historic, vision, of, its, founders, a, world, in, which, freedom, and, respect, for, human, rights, find, a, home, among, all, nations, the, gulf, war, put, this, new, world, to, its, first, test, and, my, fellow, americans, we, passed, that, test, for, sake, of, our, principles, for, sake, of, kuwaiti, people, we, stood, our, ground, because, world, would, not, look, other, way, ambassador, al-sabah, tonight, kuwais, free, and, we're, very, happy, about, that, tonight, as, our, troops, begin, to, come, home, let, us, recognize, that, hard, work, of, freedom, still, calls, us, forward, we've, learned, hard, lessons, of, history, the, victory, over, iraq, was, not, waged, as, \"\"a, war, to, end, all, wars, \"\", even, new, world, order, cannot, guarantee, an, era, of, perpetual, peace, but, enduring, peace, must, be, our, mission, our, success, in, gulf, will, shape, not, only, new, world, order, we, seek, but, our, mission, here, at, home, in, war, just, ended, there, were, clear-cut, objectives, --, timetables, --, and, above, all, an, overriding, imperative, to, achieve, results, we, must, bring, that, same, sense, of, self-discipline, that, same, sense, of, urgency, to, way, we, meet, challenges, here, at, home, in, my, state, of, union, address, and, in, my, budget, defined, a, comprehensive, agenda, to, prepare, for, next, american, century, our, first, priority, is, to, get, this, economy, rolling, again, the, fear, and, uncertainty, caused, by, gulf, crisis, were, understandable, but, now, that, war, is, over, oil, prices, are, down, interest, rates, are, down, and, confidence, is, rightly, coming, back, americans, can, move, forward, to, lend, spend, and, invest, in, this, strongest, economy, on, earth, we, must, also, enact, legislation, that, is, key, to, building, a, better, america, for, example, in, 1990, we, enacted, an, historic, clean, air, act, and, now, we've, proposed, a, national, energy, strategy, we, passed, a, child-care, bill, that, put, power, in, hands, of, parents, and, today, we're, ready, to, do, same, thing, with, our, schools, and, expand, choice, in, education, we, passed, a, crime, bill, that, made, a, useful, start, in, fighting, crime, and, drugs, this, year, we're, sending, to, congress, our, comprehensive, crime, package, to, finish, job, we, passed, landmark, americans, with, disabilities, act, and, now, we've, sent, forward, our, civil, rights, bill, we, also, passed, aviation, bill, this, year, we've, sent, up, our, new, highway, bill, and, these, are, just, a, few, of, our, pending, proposals, for, reform, and, renewal, so, tonight, call, on, congress, to, move, forward, aggressively, on, our, domestic, front, let's, begin, with, two, initiatives, we, should, be, able, to, agree, on, quickly, transportation, and, crime, and, then, let's, build, on, success, with, those, and, enact, rest, of, our, agenda, if, our, forces, could, win, ground, war, in, 100, hours, then, surely, congress, can, pass, this, legislation, in, 100, days, let, that, be, a, promise, we, make, tonight, to, american, people, when, spoke, in, this, house, about, state, of, our, union, asked, all, of, you, if, we, can, selflessly, confront, evil, for, sake, of, good, in, a, land, so, far, away, then, surely, we, can, make, this, land, all, that, should, be, in, time, since, then, brave, men, and, women, of, desert, storm, accomplished, more, than, even, they, may, realize, they, set, out, to, confront, an, enemy, abroad, and, in, process, they, transformed, a, nation, at, home, think, of, way, they, went, about, their, mission, --, with, confidence, and, quiet, pride, think, about, their, sense, of, duty, about, all, they, taught, us, about, our, values, about, ourselves, we, hear, so, often, about, our, young, people, in, turmoil, --, how, our, children, fall, short, how, our, schools, fail, us, how, american, products, and, american, workers, are, second-class, well, don't, you, believe, the, america, we, saw, in, desert, storm, was, first-class, talent, and, they, did, using, america's, state-of-the-art, technology, we, saw, excellence, embodied, in, patriot, missile, and, patriots, who, made, work, and, we, saw, soldiers, who, know, about, honor, and, bravery, and, duty, and, country, and, world-shaking, power, of, these, simple, words, there, is, something, noble, and, majestic, about, pride, about, patriotism, that, we, feel, tonight, so, to, everyone, here, and, everyone, watching, at, home, think, about, men, and, women, of, desert, storm, let, us, honor, them, with, our, gratitude, let, us, comfort, families, of, fallen, and, remember, each, precious, life, lost, let, us, learn, from, them, as, well, let, us, honor, those, who, have, served, us, by, serving, others, let, us, honor, them, as, individuals, --, men, and, women, of, every, race, all, creeds, and, colors, --, by, setting, face, of, this, nation, against, discrimination, bigotry, and, hate, eliminate, them, i'm, sure, that, many, of, you, saw, on, television, unforgettable, scene, of, four, terrified, iraqi, soldiers, surrendering, they, emerged, from, their, bunker, broken, tears, streaming, from, their, eyes, fearing, worst, and, then, there, was, an, american, soldier, remember, what, he, said?, he, said, \"\"it's, okay, you're, all, right, now, you're, all, right, now, \"\", that, scene, says, a, lot, about, america, a, lot, about, who, we, are, americans, are, a, caring, people, we, are, a, good, people, a, generous, people, let, us, always, be, caring, and, good, and, generous, in, all, we, do, soon, very, soon, our, troops, will, begin, march, we've, all, been, waiting, for, --, their, march, home, and, have, directed, secretary, cheney, to, begin, immediate, return, of, american, combat, units, from, gulf, less, than, 2, hours, from, now, first, planeload, of, american, soldiers, will, lift, off, from, saudi, arabia, headed, for, u, s, a, that, plane, will, carry, men, and, women, of, 24th, mechanized, infantry, division, bound, for, fort, stewart, georgia, this, is, just, beginning, of, a, steady, flow, of, american, troops, coming, home, let, their, return, remind, us, that, all, those, who, have, gone, before, are, linked, with, us, in, long, line, of, freedom's, march, americans, have, always, tried, to, serve, to, sacrifice, nobly, for, what, we, believe, to, be, right, tonight, ask, every, community, in, this, country, to, make, this, coming, fourth, of, july, a, day, of, special, celebration, for, our, returning, troops, they, may, have, missed, thanksgiving, and, christmas, but, can, tell, you, this, for, them, and, for, their, families, we, can, make, this, a, holiday, they'll, never, forget, in, a, very, real, sense, this, victory, belongs, to, them, --, to, privates, and, pilots, to, sergeants, and, supply, officers, to, men, and, women, in, machines, and, men, and, women, who, made, them, work, it, belongs, to, regulars, to, reserves, to, national, guard, this, victory, belongs, to, finest, fighting, force, this, nation, has, ever, known, in, its, history, we, went, halfway, around, world, to, do, what, is, moral, and, just, and, right, we, fought, hard, and, with, others, we, won, war, we, lifted, yoke, of, aggression, and, tyranny, from, a, small, country, that, many, americans, had, never, even, heard, of, and, we, ask, nothing, in, return, we're, coming, home, now, --, proud, confident, heads, high, there, is, much, that, we, must, do, at, home, and, abroad, and, we, will, do, we, are, americans, may, god, bless, this, great, nation, united, states, of, america, all, very, very, much\"]

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |Gorbachev ladies and gentlemen The basic part of vis official visof of United States of America to Soviet Union is behind us And there are many things that are important which are still ahead within framework of this big political international event These days were full of very substantial dialog over a wide spectrum of issues And must say that it's kind of difficult for me -- -- At this point Bush's earphones for translation failed guess I'll have to repeat from very beginning what said in that case Laughter Q Number two Laughter Gorbachev Now -- do you hear me now? Is everything okay? It's tolerable? already said addressing international press that we see official visof of United States to Soviet Union as a big event in our relations -- really a global event And want to say that these days we have done a great deal of work which think will create difficulties for me and in order to present in condensed form And nevertheless this vis to some extent sums up last stage of our cooperation at a very fundamental dramatic time of development of events in world when both of United States of America and Soviet Union were placed in very difficult circumstances unusual ones which demanded from them a great feeling of responsibility in taking very important decisions which have had consequences and will have consequences in further development of our cooperation and events in world And so with he and did not lose time and immediately at our first meeting we summarized overall situation in a fast-changing world and tried from these positions to look upon our cooperation evaluate our joint efforts and trying to map out some contours directions of development of this cooperation which would correspond to these changing conditions within which we have to act The showed great interest in events taking place in our country our domestic processes tried to satisfy his interest and did this on my part with a great deal of satisfaction since in his interest felt a desire to understand even more what is going on in our country and moreover felt also a feeling of solidarity in this We had an interesting substantive discussion and perhaps for first time covered following in our bilateral cooperation For first time over past period we probably accented rather strongly what our economic relationship should be like how we have to work together in this importance here so that -- or so that relationship in this area would be appropriate to international dialog which we have reached in other areas And here we have noted on basis of mutual understanding -- if not Bush will say so -- that there must be movements in accommodation as well Obviously one can do a lot in area of reform so that we can include ourselves in international economic ties To play by rules of game -- like this expression haven't invented any other one for time being That's why use term I'm familiar with We have to do a great deal and we have made our choice to continue reforms democratic changes and especially now to move decisively forward towards a market relationship a relationship of property and so on It's clear that our success in these internal affairs is tied to a great extent to process of reform in Federation And hope that have satisfied interest of about state of this as of today We both understand that this is very important for success of our work and thus we must change we must understand and will understand here in Soviet Union that basic responsibility for fate of this country for reforms for making of decisions which are very important is our prerogative our responsibility And obviously we are very interested in more fruitful cooperation with countries of West And in light of continuing discussion which we had in London within framework of my meeting at G - 7 we spoke also about this subject as well And tried to develop a thesis which expressed in London that we hope to see accommodating movement of Western countries because they too in their approaches in sphere of economic cooperation must accommodate us We are talking about removing barriers which are connected with decisions taken during cold war during arms race This is a different time; different winds are blowing And we must reevaluate all these decisions don't think they need to be preserved when our relationship is different now and we want them not only to be preserved but to be more dynamic to be based more firmly on trust Obviously question arose about participation of Soviet Union in international economic organizations and must say for first time we talked substantially about specific spheres of cooperation in implementing certain projects on basis of bilateral cooperation To speak about this briefly we spoke about cooperating in field of energy especially in area of conversion We have great possibilities here and specifically in sphere in which we are very interested that is agricultural sphere especially food distribution In this regard transmitted certain materials to as in a memoir; same was done by Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh -- gave to Secretary of State Baker in a memoir about those projects in which we could cooperate fruitfully This is a very interesting and substantive project We would want to act in such a way that in implementing these projects -- all of them -- to give a possibility to each other to earn money In other words process goes forward and there's beneffrom But there are spheres of cooperation where movement forward will not give us a chance because of additional production to make these calculations like in area of food production for example In food area here there could be interesting accomplishments an interesting project but what we get as result we need -- we have problems in food area very acute ones But we can't offer this to United States They have no interest now in buying food from us So we must implement other projects where we could earn hard currency and use this And I've named such spheres many such spheres We talked in general about continuing such works Soon we will have competent groups of specialists headed by important representatives of business circles to realize these projects And thus expanded this part and other parts will be shorter For first time we discussed very substantially sphere of bilateral relations and not only with regard to disarmament political dialog and a resolution of world problems but had such a businesslike discussion and greet this welcome and hope that will have positive consequences Then and thought about following and what do we do next? We've signed treaty and what's next? We've congratulated each other and our peoples and world with fact that such great progress has been accomplished as a result of almost a decade of work And what's next?And we did not want simply to be pragmatists here We wanted to look at problem of security stability from point of view of present-day realities Or should we simply continue negotiations which already are taking place? And there are many problems which still need to be discussed Or should we also look at world from a somewhat different position from today's heights with new reality which exists?And think that was main item of our exchange because without understanding each other in this it's hard to find keys to resolution of specific issues We agreed to continue discussion on this issue and even set up mechanisms which must be implemented in order to do this Nevertheless we also examined very many specific issues of disarmament without our -- we did not leave unattended problems of Middle East And must say and if considers appropriate he could name certain things And if you have questions we could discuss this We have worked out a joint document on this have in mind our common position with regard to Middle East think that this is a very important result of our joint work and think that fact that this position will be publicly announced will have serious influence on this process And we consider that is in a decisive stage and we should not -- and here want to use what our ministers use -- to have a window of opportunity in order to really achieve progress in this very sensitive area of international politics The and talked about situation in Europe in context of implementing agreement -- Helsinki Agreement Paris Charter and especially with regard to processes taking place in that region and specifically noted situation in Yugoslavia and expressed our position our understanding our approach to resolution of this issue -- a very serious one which worries many of us Also in a joint statement we expressed this must say that we also moved forward and discussed other things We tried to also look at many global processes and in this regard did not pass by many issues of international politics -- compared our points of view In some issues we reserved opportunity to come back to this We put off discussing this In some cases we required consultations on U S side In other cases we needed time to study issue But that means that process will continue And in this case as well we noted necessity of cooperation and interaction in resolving those many international issues which exist and which must be resolved The atmosphere was a very warm one -- sincere frank open And today we sense representatives of press -- said that press didn't want to interfere with us somewhere out in a village to talk one-on-one and in an uninhibited manner We did all of this This is also important It's very good One of members of delegation -- asked question How do you feel? -- a very important person And answer was Like at home And that's kind of atmosphere which we worked in am satisfied with fact that political dialog is developing in this way once in this hall And there are many witnesses here; want to repeat this -- talked about this to he knows this as well -- that am convinced that without what we have today in our relationship such a character of Soviet-American relations we could hardly count on everything that has happened in past year And we could hardly have interacted in such a way when world placed before us very serious problems If this had been in another time if we had faced such problems in another time would be difficult to say what would have happened But today we even understand better value of our cooperation fact that this is necessary So perhaps this is not a question of a platonic love but a deep understanding of fact that as countries and states we need each other today and tomorrow And feel and know that our peoples welcome this direction of development of our relations between our countries And from this point of view moves ahead -- far ahead -- our cooperation And thus want to ask pardon of and press am host and maybe misused but perhaps could listen to your comments as well that I'm speaking so much understood that you almost agree with everything have said Laughter Bush What heard liked Laughter Once again this might be an appropriate time for Barbara and me to thank and Mrs Gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality And yes couldn't agree more about productive nature of talks enhancement of mutual understanding This is not diplomatic language in my view this is fact You know my views on START agreement Indeed it's culmination of a long and historic negotiation And happen to believe that winners on this are young people not just in Soviet Union not just in United States but all around world And we are taking major steps in transforming our economic relations Gorbachev touched on some of this But we're going to send up trade agreement to U S Congress We're going to grant most-favored-nation status now that technicalities have been worked out We have fulfilled thus our Malta goal of normalizing our economic relationship We agreed here to tackle next challenge -- Gorbachev talked about that -- furthering economic reform in U S S R and seeking to integrate Soviet economy into international system We're going forward with space cooperation cooperation in environment And we have several joint projects in mind there Building on our historic cooperation during Gulf crisis we discussed -- and discussed our partnership in resolving longstanding regional problems As you mentioned we're putting out statements on Yugoslavia Central America And indeed want to comment now just briefly on Middle East before taking your questions We did reaffirm our mutual commitment to promote peace and genuine reconciliation between Arab States Israel and Palestinians And we believe there is an historic opportunity right now to launch a process that can lead to a just and enduring peace and to a comprehensive settlement in Middle East We share strong conviction that this historic opportunity must not be lost And while recognizing that peace cannot be imposed can only result from direct negotiations between parties United States and Soviet Union pledge to do their utmost to promote and sustain peacemaking process And to that end United States and Soviet Union acting as cosponsors are going to work to convene an October peace conference designed to launch bilateral and multilateral negotiations Invitations to conference will be issued at least 10 days prior to date conference is to convene And in interim Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh will continue to work with parties to prepare for this conference And am today asking Secretary of State Jim Baker to return to Middle East to obtain Israel's answer to our proposal for peace And again my thanks to you and I'd be prepared to take questions along with you sir Yugoslavia Q One question to Comrade Gorbachev You said that you talked with Bush about Yugoslavia What is essence of that conversation about Yugoslavia?And Bush when you received me several years ago in White House in your capacity at that time as Vice of United States of America you said to me that relations between our two countries -- there's a special relationship between Yugoslavia and United States Is that definition still valid? And whether United States is still supporting Yugoslavian territorial integrity? Gorbachev You asked about essence of conversation will then make use of fact that will relate content of U S -Soviet statement on Yugoslavia This is result of our conversation on this subject We both countries with a deep concern have noted dramatic development of events in Yugoslavia And we have been against use of force and call upon all sides to abide by agreements on cease-fire We Soviet Union and U S proceed from premise that resolution of issues must be found by peoples of Yugoslavia themselves on basis of democratic principles through peaceful negotiations and a constructive approach We emphasized necessity of having all sides respect basic principles indicated in Helsinki Act and Paris Charter The U S and U S S R support efforts undertaken by CSCE countries -- specifically European Community steps to resolve problem This is essence of statement Bush would only add sir that inasmuch as that was a joint statement that expresses our continued position as well Q can ask you fact that you're going ahead with this peace conference does that mean that you have Israel's acceptance of outlines of your conditions for a peace conference or is there still a hangup or have you got a commitment from Shamir? Bush Well would waand let Secretary Baker answer that question after this next meeting And if had to express a degree of optimism or pessimism I'd say I'm a little more optimistic today But visof Jim Baker now is for what we said here to obtain Israel's answer to our proposal for peace And if had answer in my pocket -- or he did -- I'd expect that we would say so Q have a question to both Presidents You discussed many questions of international issues bilateral issues You signed a unique agreement today What did you leave for next meeting? And can we say when you're planning to have it? Gorbachev think that what we discussed today and what we have set in motion both with regard to a political dialog and a continuation of disarmament process and new subjects in area of economic cooperation and trade interaction in resolution of important issues including regional conflicts which unfortunately still take place and especially since we have begun a significant discussion about concept of future strategic stability that means that we have many issues to discuss and many meetings ahead So think that our contacts will continue But would express myself in favor of following Perhaps not always can we go -- and this makes positions of Presidents very specific -- but it's harder for them than for Ministers of Foreign Affairs to travel and discuss issues of foreign affairs But nevertheless and have developed a method of conversation We exchange opinions by telephone As soon as we have a need concerns or simply to exchange opinions about something important we do this by telephone and this takes place on a regular basis And secondly we regularly exchange letters And this exchange of opinions has not ceased even in recent days when we have already reached agreement with We were expecting him here So we have many channels in order to support this very high level of cooperation which we have And think a great role will be given to our Departments -- Ministries of Foreign Affairs but other Departments as well because we have new areas of cooperation Bush would only add to that that though no date is set is my view -- and haven't always held this view -- that a meeting without an agenda is a good idea from time to time between Soviet and of United States And with this -- Gorbachev talked about arms control and regional problems and other problems -- but as this dynamic autonomy begins to move a chance for a dynamic economy here there's going to be much more to talk about on economic side than we've ever had before -- cooperation partnerships joint ventures The whole approach to economics that he has endorsed that is going to benef believe Soviet Union and think there's enormous potential for United States So is my view that we've got plenty to talk about And for one would be prepared to as I've stated before to have a meeting where there's not a crisis out there to be managed; rather we can be sure that we're not two ships passing in night -- analogy used believe in Malta -- appropriately Laughter And look forward to future meetings because you get a lot done where you can't put out -- sign a 3-point program or a 20-point protocol But a lot is done just by kinds of conversations we've had today Q Gorbachev there was an ugly border incident in Lithuania last night in which a number of Lithuanian border guards were killed wonder if we could have your reaction and any explanation you might have of it?Also Bush any reaction from you in light particularly of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for Baltic States? Gorbachev You know we received this information when we were talking outside city The first information was such that incident was on border between Lithuania and Byelorussia and when one of citizens of Byelorussia went in direction of Lithuania and at customs point where he was approaching he saw two wounded people and four that died He quickly related this information and now state security agency of Lithuania and Byelorussia -- chairman of state committee on security offered also to help in cooperation So now we are investigating this must say that in addition to regret we must simply sympathize with families of people that died And myself must say that we are doing everything in order not only to take actions but also to avoid such excesses such conflicts on basis of resolution of basic issues And we have taken such basic mutual decisions with regard to issues -- concerning Armenia and Azerbaijan there's a dialog And faster and more productive dialog is more efforts there are to break down Not everyone likes this process that is developed in such a direction And it's hard for us to say what happened We heard versions and but these are versions This is not important at any rate will be monitoring this and we will tell you what was that happened in reality Q just wanted to get your reaction sir to incident in light of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for Baltic States Bush Well don't think there's a connection but do regret violence listened to what Gorbachev said about discussion We clearly favor negotiation -- he knows that -- that would lead to a reduction of cross-border violence from both sides And obviously I'd like to join in expressing my regrets to those families whose loved ones are lost But immediately got on this and said they're conducting an investigation think there's hope that investigation will be cooperative between Lithuanian side and Byelorussia's side And so we can't prejudge incident but had an opportunity to express my views to Gorbachev on whole question of Baltic States don't think it's fair to link a border incident before you know what happened to that question however Soviet Economic Integration Q how far did you go after London in moving ahead in integration of U S S R into international economy? Was there progress reached in this area? Gorbachev Perhaps you can begin Bush Well let me say that's a serious objective to start with Secondly believe that active participation in these international financial institutions and status that was deemed best by G - 7 is most important thing that Soviets can do right now have freed up as you heard today certain trade benefits or normalizing trade procedures that in my view will help And we've done that since meeting in London But answer is full participation -- full benefof these international institutions require full knowledge and steps towards privatization and toward convertability all things that believe Soviet Union wants So work with international organizations and then bilaterally do what we've done and other countries will be doing too I'm sure to remove underbrush remove barriers to bilateral economic cooperation So quite a bhas happened between us since Paris And we look forward with our representatives in these international organizations to working very cooperatively with Soviet leaders Gorbachev understand that I'm supposed to comment on this as well since question was to both Presidents will be brief since have already expressed my opinion about this London was beginning of a very important process This was meaning of London meeting and one must judge about this in that light It's very important that after London there's a desire on both parts to work out a mechanism which would perm shifting of this cooperation given political will of leadership of Western countries In Soviet Union we think that we should have special structures which would keep tab of cooperation between Soviet Union and G - 7 countries and first of all in area of investment so process would be easier in taking of decisions of mutual interest And it's good that mechanism has started to be implemented which we discussed in London and Minister of Finances of England is already here We first talked about fact that there would be visits of Minister of Finance Secretary of Treasury of U S and representative of FRG So in other words there would be mechanism of implementing specific areas of cooperation And this is very important that there be a mechanism for real interaction And finally mentioned that on part of U S an important decision will be taken to make trade between our countries easier would say that mention this in passing but we often discussed this with asked and we agreed to study question of COCOM restrictions today because many billion-dollar projects which are ready to go and even signed are not being implemented because of fact that they have elements that come under COCOM restrictions And therefore a very serious process has started and think that this will continue and grow stronger be more specific It will give results There is a will and a desire to do this It's very important Nuclear Weapons Q would ask both of you to think back to 1986 Reykjavik summwhen Ronald Reagan horrified quite a few American nuclear experts and almost all of European leaders by giving serious consideration to your proposal Gorbachev for a ban on all nuclear weapons In end Reagan said no because of belief that nuclear deterrence has in fact kept peace At that time you had a massive conventional edge in Europe though Since then we've had CFE treaty Why now are two of you not saying we will now work towards a total nuclear ban? Do you still believe in efficacy of nuclear deterrence in keeping peace? Particularly sir ask you Bush given fact that some of these breakaway Republics they have nuclear weapons in there and who knows what would happen if they declare independence Bush The very fact that -- wouldn't suggest that a breakaway Republic is going to use a nuclear weapon against United States but would suggest that we have every reason in world to be concerned about renegades -- not in these areas perhaps; hope not -- getting hold of nuclear weapons And that's one of reasons strongly support our GPALS program that is being debated in Senate right now But in my view other countries do possess nuclear weapons It's not just Soviet Union and United States And do believe that we are on right path by path that Gorbachev has outlined today on following on existing agreements So rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer let's follow through practically as he suggested And then as far as U S is concerned I'd like us to go forward with a system that puts nobody at threat nobody at risk The only thing at risk is an errant nuclear missile aiming at a country And that's why support defensive approach and that's why think one of lessons out of Iraq war -- and maybe Gorbachev reads this differently -- is that defenses work And though we're talking about a different concept now an expanded concept a more high-tech concept think a lot of lives were saved by defense So that's my reply Gorbachev will say a few words think that argument which you want to ascribe to me that in my policy looked upon nuclear weapons as an element of deterrence is not true have not said this Yes we got involved in arms race in a very serious way Thank God as we say in Russian that we stopped this and turned back And this is a great accomplishment since we understood where we were headed But it's hard to resolve all these issues which have piled up and all these weapons that have piled up And think that there is still a lot that we have to do We have mapped out a few things for future and then there will probably also be questions put to all members of nuclear club and they also have to think about what to do with nuclear weapons in future And finally we must very carefully act about having mechanism which we have created and which seems has worked -- but apparently not effectively enough -- about nonproliferation of nuclear weapons This was one of important topics of our conversation with during these days For if certain countries will lower their arms and disarm and head in direction of a nonnuclear world and at same time others will find ways to develop process in order to have their own nuclear weapons then we will have a situation which is absurd So in continuing to support nuclear disarmament and within framework of negotiation process which we have we have agreed to continue this We have question of truly improving mechanism of nonproliferation nuclear technology in order -- missile technology -- in order to create an unsurmountable barrier in this area think this is one of most important things we have to do today Q What significance does process of European integration have in your conversations with for example postwar unification of Europe? What image of this is most acceptable to you from point of view of Soviet Union? For example image of a General de Gaulle Europe of fatherlands countries with decisions being made on a national level or a united states of Europe with common decision being made among them? Gorbachev First of all you can probably guess that everything that happens in Europe -- in world -- we have always looked towards Europe for everything that happens in Europe in our areas -- don't want to list them -- has a great importance for developments in world So undoubtedly and noted positive developments which are taking place in Europe and we noted support of documents aimed at creating a new Europe And we see that Soviet Union and U S must participate very actively in building a new Europe All of this has existed and continues to exist And we feel a responsibility to do this But you asked question about how think perhaps you are a little hasty because when we are creating a certain schematic and then try to impose then we get one result When a process is being developed in a logical way within Helsinki process a political process of choice then we find that new forms of cooperation an                  |29000 |[gorbachev, ladies, and, gentlemen, the, basic, part, of, vis, official, visof, of, united, states, of, america, to, soviet, union, is, behind, us, and, there, are, many, things, that, are, important, which, are, still, ahead, within, framework, of, this, big, political, international, event, these, days, were, full, of, very, substantial, dialog, over, a, wide, spectrum, of, issues, and, must, say, that, it's, kind, of, difficult, for, me, --, --, at, this, point, bush's, earphones, for, translation, failed, guess, i'll, have, to, repeat, from, very, beginning, what, said, in, that, case, laughter, q, number, two, laughter, gorbachev, now, --, do, you, hear, me, now?, is, everything, okay?, it's, tolerable?, already, said, addressing, international, press, that, we, see, official, visof, of, united, states, to, soviet, union, as, a, big, event, in, our, relations, --, really, a, global, event, and, want, to, say, that, these, days, we, have, done, a, great, deal, of, work, which, think, will, create, difficulties, for, me, and, in, order, to, present, in, condensed, form, and, nevertheless, this, vis, to, some, extent, sums, up, last, stage, of, our, cooperation, at, a, very, fundamental, dramatic, time, of, development, of, events, in, world, when, both, of, united, states, of, america, and, soviet, union, were, placed, in, very, difficult, circumstances, unusual, ones, which, demanded, from, them, a, great, feeling, of, responsibility, in, taking, very, important, decisions, which, have, had, consequences, and, will, have, consequences, in, further, development, of, our, cooperation, and, events, in, world, and, so, with, he, and, did, not, lose, time, and, immediately, at, our, first, meeting, we, summarized, overall, situation, in, a, fast-changing, world, and, tried, from, these, positions, to, look, upon, our, cooperation, evaluate, our, joint, efforts, and, trying, to, map, out, some, contours, directions, of, development, of, this, cooperation, which, would, correspond, to, these, changing, conditions, within, which, we, have, to, act, the, showed, great, interest, in, events, taking, place, in, our, country, our, domestic, processes, tried, to, satisfy, his, interest, and, did, this, on, my, part, with, a, great, deal, of, satisfaction, since, in, his, interest, felt, a, desire, to, understand, even, more, what, is, going, on, in, our, country, and, moreover, felt, also, a, feeling, of, solidarity, in, this, we, had, an, interesting, substantive, discussion, and, perhaps, for, first, time, covered, following, in, our, bilateral, cooperation, for, first, time, over, past, period, we, probably, accented, rather, strongly, what, our, economic, relationship, should, be, like, how, we, have, to, work, together, in, this, importance, here, so, that, --, or, so, that, relationship, in, this, area, would, be, appropriate, to, international, dialog, which, we, have, reached, in, other, areas, and, here, we, have, noted, on, basis, of, mutual, understanding, --, if, not, bush, will, say, so, --, that, there, must, be, movements, in, accommodation, as, well, obviously, one, can, do, a, lot, in, area, of, reform, so, that, we, can, include, ourselves, in, international, economic, ties, to, play, by, rules, of, game, --, like, this, expression, haven't, invented, any, other, one, for, time, being, that's, why, use, term, i'm, familiar, with, we, have, to, do, a, great, deal, and, we, have, made, our, choice, to, continue, reforms, democratic, changes, and, especially, now, to, move, decisively, forward, towards, a, market, relationship, a, relationship, of, property, and, so, on, it's, clear, that, our, success, in, these, internal, affairs, is, tied, to, a, great, extent, to, process, of, reform, in, federation, and, hope, that, have, satisfied, interest, of, about, state, of, this, as, of, today, we, both, understand, that, this, is, very, important, for, success, of, our, work, and, thus, we, must, change, we, must, understand, and, will, understand, here, in, soviet, union, that, basic, responsibility, for, fate, of, this, country, for, reforms, for, making, of, decisions, which, are, very, important, is, our, prerogative, our, responsibility, and, obviously, we, are, very, interested, in, more, fruitful, cooperation, with, countries, of, west, and, in, light, of, continuing, discussion, which, we, had, in, london, within, framework, of, my, meeting, at, g, -, 7, we, spoke, also, about, this, subject, as, well, and, tried, to, develop, a, thesis, which, expressed, in, london, that, we, hope, to, see, accommodating, movement, of, western, countries, because, they, too, in, their, approaches, in, sphere, of, economic, cooperation, must, accommodate, us, we, are, talking, about, removing, barriers, which, are, connected, with, decisions, taken, during, cold, war, during, arms, race, this, is, a, different, time;, different, winds, are, blowing, and, we, must, reevaluate, all, these, decisions, don't, think, they, need, to, be, preserved, when, our, relationship, is, different, now, and, we, want, them, not, only, to, be, preserved, but, to, be, more, dynamic, to, be, based, more, firmly, on, trust, obviously, question, arose, about, participation, of, soviet, union, in, international, economic, organizations, and, must, say, for, first, time, we, talked, substantially, about, specific, spheres, of, cooperation, in, implementing, certain, projects, on, basis, of, bilateral, cooperation, to, speak, about, this, briefly, we, spoke, about, cooperating, in, field, of, energy, especially, in, area, of, conversion, we, have, great, possibilities, here, and, specifically, in, sphere, in, which, we, are, very, interested, that, is, agricultural, sphere, especially, food, distribution, in, this, regard, transmitted, certain, materials, to, as, in, a, memoir;, same, was, done, by, foreign, minister, bessmertnykh, --, gave, to, secretary, of, state, baker, in, a, memoir, about, those, projects, in, which, we, could, cooperate, fruitfully, this, is, a, very, interesting, and, substantive, project, we, would, want, to, act, in, such, a, way, that, in, implementing, these, projects, --, all, of, them, --, to, give, a, possibility, to, each, other, to, earn, money, in, other, words, process, goes, forward, and, there's, beneffrom, but, there, are, spheres, of, cooperation, where, movement, forward, will, not, give, us, a, chance, because, of, additional, production, to, make, these, calculations, like, in, area, of, food, production, for, example, in, food, area, here, there, could, be, interesting, accomplishments, an, interesting, project, but, what, we, get, as, result, we, need, --, we, have, problems, in, food, area, very, acute, ones, but, we, can't, offer, this, to, united, states, they, have, no, interest, now, in, buying, food, from, us, so, we, must, implement, other, projects, where, we, could, earn, hard, currency, and, use, this, and, i've, named, such, spheres, many, such, spheres, we, talked, in, general, about, continuing, such, works, soon, we, will, have, competent, groups, of, specialists, headed, by, important, representatives, of, business, circles, to, realize, these, projects, and, thus, expanded, this, part, and, other, parts, will, be, shorter, for, first, time, we, discussed, very, substantially, sphere, of, bilateral, relations, and, not, only, with, regard, to, disarmament, political, dialog, and, a, resolution, of, world, problems, but, had, such, a, businesslike, discussion, and, greet, this, welcome, and, hope, that, will, have, positive, consequences, then, and, thought, about, following, and, what, do, we, do, next?, we've, signed, treaty, and, what's, next?, we've, congratulated, each, other, and, our, peoples, and, world, with, fact, that, such, great, progress, has, been, accomplished, as, a, result, of, almost, a, decade, of, work, and, what's, next?and, we, did, not, want, simply, to, be, pragmatists, here, we, wanted, to, look, at, problem, of, security, stability, from, point, of, view, of, present-day, realities, or, should, we, simply, continue, negotiations, which, already, are, taking, place?, and, there, are, many, problems, which, still, need, to, be, discussed, or, should, we, also, look, at, world, from, a, somewhat, different, position, from, today's, heights, with, new, reality, which, exists?and, think, that, was, main, item, of, our, exchange, because, without, understanding, each, other, in, this, it's, hard, to, find, keys, to, resolution, of, specific, issues, we, agreed, to, continue, discussion, on, this, issue, and, even, set, up, mechanisms, which, must, be, implemented, in, order, to, do, this, nevertheless, we, also, examined, very, many, specific, issues, of, disarmament, without, our, --, we, did, not, leave, unattended, problems, of, middle, east, and, must, say, and, if, considers, appropriate, he, could, name, certain, things, and, if, you, have, questions, we, could, discuss, this, we, have, worked, out, a, joint, document, on, this, have, in, mind, our, common, position, with, regard, to, middle, east, think, that, this, is, a, very, important, result, of, our, joint, work, and, think, that, fact, that, this, position, will, be, publicly, announced, will, have, serious, influence, on, this, process, and, we, consider, that, is, in, a, decisive, stage, and, we, should, not, --, and, here, want, to, use, what, our, ministers, use, --, to, have, a, window, of, opportunity, in, order, to, really, achieve, progress, in, this, very, sensitive, area, of, international, politics, the, and, talked, about, situation, in, europe, in, context, of, implementing, agreement, --, helsinki, agreement, paris, charter, and, especially, with, regard, to, processes, taking, place, in, that, region, and, specifically, noted, situation, in, yugoslavia, and, expressed, our, position, our, understanding, our, approach, to, resolution, of, this, issue, --, a, very, serious, one, which, worries, many, of, us, also, in, a, joint, statement, we, expressed, this, must, say, that, we, also, moved, forward, and, discussed, other, things, we, tried, to, also, look, at, many, global, processes, and, in, this, regard, did, not, pass, by, many, issues, of, international, politics, --, compared, our, points, of, view, in, some, issues, we, reserved, opportunity, to, come, back, to, this, we, put, off, discussing, this, in, some, cases, we, required, consultations, on, u, s, side, in, other, cases, we, needed, time, to, study, issue, but, that, means, that, process, will, continue, and, in, this, case, as, well, we, noted, necessity, of, cooperation, and, interaction, in, resolving, those, many, international, issues, which, exist, and, which, must, be, resolved, the, atmosphere, was, a, very, warm, one, --, sincere, frank, open, and, today, we, sense, representatives, of, press, --, said, that, press, didn't, want, to, interfere, with, us, somewhere, out, in, a, village, to, talk, one-on-one, and, in, an, uninhibited, manner, we, did, all, of, this, this, is, also, important, it's, very, good, one, of, members, of, delegation, --, asked, question, how, do, you, feel?, --, a, very, important, person, and, answer, was, like, at, home, and, that's, kind, of, atmosphere, which, we, worked, in, am, satisfied, with, fact, that, political, dialog, is, developing, in, this, way, once, in, this, hall, and, there, are, many, witnesses, here;, want, to, repeat, this, --, talked, about, this, to, he, knows, this, as, well, --, that, am, convinced, that, without, what, we, have, today, in, our, relationship, such, a, character, of, soviet-american, relations, we, could, hardly, count, on, everything, that, has, happened, in, past, year, and, we, could, hardly, have, interacted, in, such, a, way, when, world, placed, before, us, very, serious, problems, if, this, had, been, in, another, time, if, we, had, faced, such, problems, in, another, time, would, be, difficult, to, say, what, would, have, happened, but, today, we, even, understand, better, value, of, our, cooperation, fact, that, this, is, necessary, so, perhaps, this, is, not, a, question, of, a, platonic, love, but, a, deep, understanding, of, fact, that, as, countries, and, states, we, need, each, other, today, and, tomorrow, and, feel, and, know, that, our, peoples, welcome, this, direction, of, development, of, our, relations, between, our, countries, and, from, this, point, of, view, moves, ahead, --, far, ahead, --, our, cooperation, and, thus, want, to, ask, pardon, of, and, press, am, host, and, maybe, misused, but, perhaps, could, listen, to, your, comments, as, well, that, i'm, speaking, so, much, understood, that, you, almost, agree, with, everything, have, said, laughter, bush, what, heard, liked, laughter, once, again, this, might, be, an, appropriate, time, for, barbara, and, me, to, thank, and, mrs, gorbachev, for, this, fantastic, hospitality, and, yes, couldn't, agree, more, about, productive, nature, of, talks, enhancement, of, mutual, understanding, this, is, not, diplomatic, language, in, my, view, this, is, fact, you, know, my, views, on, start, agreement, indeed, it's, culmination, of, a, long, and, historic, negotiation, and, happen, to, believe, that, winners, on, this, are, young, people, not, just, in, soviet, union, not, just, in, united, states, but, all, around, world, and, we, are, taking, major, steps, in, transforming, our, economic, relations, gorbachev, touched, on, some, of, this, but, we're, going, to, send, up, trade, agreement, to, u, s, congress, we're, going, to, grant, most-favored-nation, status, now, that, technicalities, have, been, worked, out, we, have, fulfilled, thus, our, malta, goal, of, normalizing, our, economic, relationship, we, agreed, here, to, tackle, next, challenge, --, gorbachev, talked, about, that, --, furthering, economic, reform, in, u, s, s, r, and, seeking, to, integrate, soviet, economy, into, international, system, we're, going, forward, with, space, cooperation, cooperation, in, environment, and, we, have, several, joint, projects, in, mind, there, building, on, our, historic, cooperation, during, gulf, crisis, we, discussed, --, and, discussed, our, partnership, in, resolving, longstanding, regional, problems, as, you, mentioned, we're, putting, out, statements, on, yugoslavia, central, america, and, indeed, want, to, comment, now, just, briefly, on, middle, east, before, taking, your, questions, we, did, reaffirm, our, mutual, commitment, to, promote, peace, and, genuine, reconciliation, between, arab, states, israel, and, palestinians, and, we, believe, there, is, an, historic, opportunity, right, now, to, launch, a, process, that, can, lead, to, a, just, and, enduring, peace, and, to, a, comprehensive, settlement, in, middle, east, we, share, strong, conviction, that, this, historic, opportunity, must, not, be, lost, and, while, recognizing, that, peace, cannot, be, imposed, can, only, result, from, direct, negotiations, between, parties, united, states, and, soviet, union, pledge, to, do, their, utmost, to, promote, and, sustain, peacemaking, process, and, to, that, end, united, states, and, soviet, union, acting, as, cosponsors, are, going, to, work, to, convene, an, october, peace, conference, designed, to, launch, bilateral, and, multilateral, negotiations, invitations, to, conference, will, be, issued, at, least, 10, days, prior, to, date, conference, is, to, convene, and, in, interim, secretary, baker, and, foreign, minister, bessmertnykh, will, continue, to, work, with, parties, to, prepare, for, this, conference, and, am, today, asking, secretary, of, state, jim, baker, to, return, to, middle, east, to, obtain, israel's, answer, to, our, proposal, for, peace, and, again, my, thanks, to, you, and, i'd, be, prepared, to, take, questions, along, with, you, sir, yugoslavia, q, one, question, to, comrade, gorbachev, you, said, that, you, talked, with, bush, about, yugoslavia, what, is, essence, of, that, conversation, about, yugoslavia?and, bush, when, you, received, me, several, years, ago, in, white, house, in, your, capacity, at, that, time, as, vice, of, united, states, of, america, you, said, to, me, that, relations, between, our, two, countries, --, there's, a, special, relationship, between, yugoslavia, and, united, states, is, that, definition, still, valid?, and, whether, united, states, is, still, supporting, yugoslavian, territorial, integrity?, gorbachev, you, asked, about, essence, of, conversation, will, then, make, use, of, fact, that, will, relate, content, of, u, s, -soviet, statement, on, yugoslavia, this, is, result, of, our, conversation, on, this, subject, we, both, countries, with, a, deep, concern, have, noted, dramatic, development, of, events, in, yugoslavia, and, we, have, been, against, use, of, force, and, call, upon, all, sides, to, abide, by, agreements, on, cease-fire, we, soviet, union, and, u, s, proceed, from, premise, that, resolution, of, issues, must, be, found, by, peoples, of, yugoslavia, themselves, on, basis, of, democratic, principles, through, peaceful, negotiations, and, a, constructive, approach, we, emphasized, necessity, of, having, all, sides, respect, basic, principles, indicated, in, helsinki, act, and, paris, charter, the, u, s, and, u, s, s, r, support, efforts, undertaken, by, csce, countries, --, specifically, european, community, steps, to, resolve, problem, this, is, essence, of, statement, bush, would, only, add, sir, that, inasmuch, as, that, was, a, joint, statement, that, expresses, our, continued, position, as, well, q, can, ask, you, fact, that, you're, going, ahead, with, this, peace, conference, does, that, mean, that, you, have, israel's, acceptance, of, outlines, of, your, conditions, for, a, peace, conference, or, is, there, still, a, hangup, or, have, you, got, a, commitment, from, shamir?, bush, well, would, waand, let, secretary, baker, answer, that, question, after, this, next, meeting, and, if, had, to, express, a, degree, of, optimism, or, pessimism, i'd, say, i'm, a, little, more, optimistic, today, but, visof, jim, baker, now, is, for, what, we, said, here, to, obtain, israel's, answer, to, our, proposal, for, peace, and, if, had, answer, in, my, pocket, --, or, he, did, --, i'd, expect, that, we, would, say, so, q, have, a, question, to, both, presidents, you, discussed, many, questions, of, international, issues, bilateral, issues, you, signed, a, unique, agreement, today, what, did, you, leave, for, next, meeting?, and, can, we, say, when, you're, planning, to, have, it?, gorbachev, think, that, what, we, discussed, today, and, what, we, have, set, in, motion, both, with, regard, to, a, political, dialog, and, a, continuation, of, disarmament, process, and, new, subjects, in, area, of, economic, cooperation, and, trade, interaction, in, resolution, of, important, issues, including, regional, conflicts, which, unfortunately, still, take, place, and, especially, since, we, have, begun, a, significant, discussion, about, concept, of, future, strategic, stability, that, means, that, we, have, many, issues, to, discuss, and, many, meetings, ahead, so, think, that, our, contacts, will, continue, but, would, express, myself, in, favor, of, following, perhaps, not, always, can, we, go, --, and, this, makes, positions, of, presidents, very, specific, --, but, it's, harder, for, them, than, for, ministers, of, foreign, affairs, to, travel, and, discuss, issues, of, foreign, affairs, but, nevertheless, and, have, developed, a, method, of, conversation, we, exchange, opinions, by, telephone, as, soon, as, we, have, a, need, concerns, or, simply, to, exchange, opinions, about, something, important, we, do, this, by, telephone, and, this, takes, place, on, a, regular, basis, and, secondly, we, regularly, exchange, letters, and, this, exchange, of, opinions, has, not, ceased, even, in, recent, days, when, we, have, already, reached, agreement, with, we, were, expecting, him, here, so, we, have, many, channels, in, order, to, support, this, very, high, level, of, cooperation, which, we, have, and, think, a, great, role, will, be, given, to, our, departments, --, ministries, of, foreign, affairs, but, other, departments, as, well, because, we, have, new, areas, of, cooperation, bush, would, only, add, to, that, that, though, no, date, is, set, is, my, view, --, and, haven't, always, held, this, view, --, that, a, meeting, without, an, agenda, is, a, good, idea, from, time, to, time, between, soviet, and, of, united, states, and, with, this, --, gorbachev, talked, about, arms, control, and, regional, problems, and, other, problems, --, but, as, this, dynamic, autonomy, begins, to, move, a, chance, for, a, dynamic, economy, here, there's, going, to, be, much, more, to, talk, about, on, economic, side, than, we've, ever, had, before, --, cooperation, partnerships, joint, ventures, the, whole, approach, to, economics, that, he, has, endorsed, that, is, going, to, benef, believe, soviet, union, and, think, there's, enormous, potential, for, united, states, so, is, my, view, that, we've, got, plenty, to, talk, about, and, for, one, would, be, prepared, to, as, i've, stated, before, to, have, a, meeting, where, there's, not, a, crisis, out, there, to, be, managed;, rather, we, can, be, sure, that, we're, not, two, ships, passing, in, night, --, analogy, used, believe, in, malta, --, appropriately, laughter, and, look, forward, to, future, meetings, because, you, get, a, lot, done, where, you, can't, put, out, --, sign, a, 3-point, program, or, a, 20-point, protocol, but, a, lot, is, done, just, by, kinds, of, conversations, we've, had, today, q, gorbachev, there, was, an, ugly, border, incident, in, lithuania, last, night, in, which, a, number, of, lithuanian, border, guards, were, killed, wonder, if, we, could, have, your, reaction, and, any, explanation, you, might, have, of, it?also, bush, any, reaction, from, you, in, light, particularly, of, your, call, yesterday, afternoon, for, freedom, for, baltic, states?, gorbachev, you, know, we, received, this, information, when, we, were, talking, outside, city, the, first, information, was, such, that, incident, was, on, border, between, lithuania, and, byelorussia, and, when, one, of, citizens, of, byelorussia, went, in, direction, of, lithuania, and, at, customs, point, where, he, was, approaching, he, saw, two, wounded, people, and, four, that, died, he, quickly, related, this, information, and, now, state, security, agency, of, lithuania, and, byelorussia, --, chairman, of, state, committee, on, security, offered, also, to, help, in, cooperation, so, now, we, are, investigating, this, must, say, that, in, addition, to, regret, we, must, simply, sympathize, with, families, of, people, that, died, and, myself, must, say, that, we, are, doing, everything, in, order, not, only, to, take, actions, but, also, to, avoid, such, excesses, such, conflicts, on, basis, of, resolution, of, basic, issues, and, we, have, taken, such, basic, mutual, decisions, with, regard, to, issues, --, concerning, armenia, and, azerbaijan, there's, a, dialog, and, faster, and, more, productive, dialog, is, more, efforts, there, are, to, break, down, not, everyone, likes, this, process, that, is, developed, in, such, a, direction, and, it's, hard, for, us, to, say, what, happened, we, heard, versions, and, but, these, are, versions, this, is, not, important, at, any, rate, will, be, monitoring, this, and, we, will, tell, you, what, was, that, happened, in, reality, q, just, wanted, to, get, your, reaction, sir, to, incident, in, light, of, your, call, yesterday, afternoon, for, freedom, for, baltic, states, bush, well, don't, think, there's, a, connection, but, do, regret, violence, listened, to, what, gorbachev, said, about, discussion, we, clearly, favor, negotiation, --, he, knows, that, --, that, would, lead, to, a, reduction, of, cross-border, violence, from, both, sides, and, obviously, i'd, like, to, join, in, expressing, my, regrets, to, those, families, whose, loved, ones, are, lost, but, immediately, got, on, this, and, said, they're, conducting, an, investigation, think, there's, hope, that, investigation, will, be, cooperative, between, lithuanian, side, and, byelorussia's, side, and, so, we, can't, prejudge, incident, but, had, an, opportunity, to, express, my, views, to, gorbachev, on, whole, question, of, baltic, states, don't, think, it's, fair, to, link, a, border, incident, before, you, know, what, happened, to, that, question, however, soviet, economic, integration, q, how, far, did, you, go, after, london, in, moving, ahead, in, integration, of, u, s, s, r, into, international, economy?, was, there, progress, reached, in, this, area?, gorbachev, perhaps, you, can, begin, bush, well, let, me, say, that's, a, serious, objective, to, start, with, secondly, believe, that, active, participation, in, these, international, financial, institutions, and, status, that, was, deemed, best, by, g, -, 7, is, most, important, thing, that, soviets, can, do, right, now, have, freed, up, as, you, heard, today, certain, trade, benefits, or, normalizing, trade, procedures, that, in, my, view, will, help, and, we've, done, that, since, meeting, in, london, but, answer, is, full, participation, --, full, benefof, these, international, institutions, require, full, knowledge, and, steps, towards, privatization, and, toward, convertability, all, things, that, believe, soviet, union, wants, so, work, with, international, organizations, and, then, bilaterally, do, what, we've, done, and, other, countries, will, be, doing, too, i'm, sure, to, remove, underbrush, remove, barriers, to, bilateral, economic, cooperation, so, quite, a, bhas, happened, between, us, since, paris, and, we, look, forward, with, our, representatives, in, these, international, organizations, to, working, very, cooperatively, with, soviet, leaders, gorbachev, understand, that, i'm, supposed, to, comment, on, this, as, well, since, question, was, to, both, presidents, will, be, brief, since, have, already, expressed, my, opinion, about, this, london, was, beginning, of, a, very, important, process, this, was, meaning, of, london, meeting, and, one, must, judge, about, this, in, that, light, it's, very, important, that, after, london, there's, a, desire, on, both, parts, to, work, out, a, mechanism, which, would, perm, shifting, of, this, cooperation, given, political, will, of, leadership, of, western, countries, in, soviet, union, we, think, that, we, should, have, special, structures, which, would, keep, tab, of, cooperation, between, soviet, union, and, g, -, 7, countries, and, first, of, all, in, area, of, investment, so, process, would, be, easier, in, taking, of, decisions, of, mutual, interest, and, it's, good, that, mechanism, has, started, to, be, implemented, which, we, discussed, in, london, and, minister, of, finances, of, england, is, already, here, we, first, talked, about, fact, that, there, would, be, visits, of, minister, of, finance, secretary, of, treasury, of, u, s, and, representative, of, frg, so, in, other, words, there, would, be, mechanism, of, implementing, specific, areas, of, cooperation, and, this, is, very, important, that, there, be, a, mechanism, for, real, interaction, and, finally, mentioned, that, on, part, of, u, s, an, important, decision, will, be, taken, to, make, trade, between, our, countries, easier, would, say, that, mention, this, in, passing, but, we, often, discussed, this, with, asked, and, we, agreed, to, study, question, of, cocom, restrictions, today, because, many, billion-dollar, projects, which, are, ready, to, go, and, even, signed, are, not, being, implemented, because, of, fact, that, they, have, elements, that, come, under, cocom, restrictions, and, therefore, a, very, serious, process, has, started, and, think, that, this, will, continue, and, grow, stronger, be, more, specific, it, will, give, results, there, is, a, will, and, a, desire, to, do, this, it's, very, important, nuclear, weapons, q, would, ask, both, of, you, to, think, back, to, 1986, reykjavik, summwhen, ronald, reagan, horrified, quite, a, few, american, nuclear, experts, and, almost, all, of, european, leaders, by, giving, serious, consideration, to, your, proposal, gorbachev, for, a, ban, on, all, nuclear, weapons, in, end, reagan, said, no, because, of, belief, that, nuclear, deterrence, has, in, fact, kept, peace, at, that, time, you, had, a, massive, conventional, edge, in, europe, though, since, then, we've, had, cfe, treaty, why, now, are, two, of, you, not, saying, we, will, now, work, towards, a, total, nuclear, ban?, do, you, still, believe, in, efficacy, of, nuclear, deterrence, in, keeping, peace?, particularly, sir, ask, you, bush, given, fact, that, some, of, these, breakaway, republics, they, have, nuclear, weapons, in, there, and, who, knows, what, would, happen, if, they, declare, independence, bush, the, very, fact, that, --, wouldn't, suggest, that, a, breakaway, republic, is, going, to, use, a, nuclear, weapon, against, united, states, but, would, suggest, that, we, have, every, reason, in, world, to, be, concerned, about, renegades, --, not, in, these, areas, perhaps;, hope, not, --, getting, hold, of, nuclear, weapons, and, that's, one, of, reasons, strongly, support, our, gpals, program, that, is, being, debated, in, senate, right, now, but, in, my, view, other, countries, do, possess, nuclear, weapons, it's, not, just, soviet, union, and, united, states, and, do, believe, that, we, are, on, right, path, by, path, that, gorbachev, has, outlined, today, on, following, on, existing, agreements, so, rather, than, try, to, have, a, ethereal, or, a, utopian, answer, let's, follow, through, practically, as, he, suggested, and, then, as, far, as, u, s, is, concerned, i'd, like, us, to, go, forward, with, a, system, that, puts, nobody, at, threat, nobody, at, risk, the, only, thing, at, risk, is, an, errant, nuclear, missile, aiming, at, a, country, and, that's, why, support, defensive, approach, and, that's, why, think, one, of, lessons, out, of, iraq, war, --, and, maybe, gorbachev, reads, this, differently, --, is, that, defenses, work, and, though, we're, talking, about, a, different, concept, now, an, expanded, concept, a, more, high-tech, concept, think, a, lot, of, lives, were, saved, by, defense, so, that's, my, reply, gorbachev, will, say, a, few, words, think, that, argument, which, you, want, to, ascribe, to, me, that, in, my, policy, looked, upon, nuclear, weapons, as, an, element, of, deterrence, is, not, true, have, not, said, this, yes, we, got, involved, in, arms, race, in, a, very, serious, way, thank, god, as, we, say, in, russian, that, we, stopped, this, and, turned, back, and, this, is, a, great, accomplishment, since, we, understood, where, we, were, headed, but, it's, hard, to, resolve, all, these, issues, which, have, piled, up, and, all, these, weapons, that, have, piled, up, and, think, that, there, is, still, a, lot, that, we, have, to, do, we, have, mapped, out, a, few, things, for, future, and, then, there, will, probably, also, be, questions, put, to, all, members, of, nuclear, club, and, they, also, have, to, think, about, what, to, do, with, nuclear, weapons, in, future, and, finally, we, must, very, carefully, act, about, having, mechanism, which, we, have, created, and, which, seems, has, worked, --, but, apparently, not, effectively, enough, --, about, nonproliferation, of, nuclear, weapons, this, was, one, of, important, topics, of, our, conversation, with, during, these, days, for, if, certain, countries, will, lower, their, arms, and, disarm, and, head, in, direction, of, a, nonnuclear, world, and, at, same, time, others, will, find, ways, to, develop, process, in, order, to, have, their, own, nuclear, weapons, then, we, will, have, a, situation, which, is, absurd, so, in, continuing, to, support, nuclear, disarmament, and, within, framework, of, negotiation, process, which, we, have, we, have, agreed, to, continue, this, we, have, question, of, truly, improving, mechanism, of, nonproliferation, nuclear, technology, in, order, --, missile, technology, --, in, order, to, create, an, unsurmountable, barrier, in, this, area, think, this, is, one, of, most, important, things, we, have, to, do, today, q, what, significance, does, process, of, european, integration, have, in, your, conversations, with, for, example, postwar, unification, of, europe?, what, image, of, this, is, most, acceptable, to, you, from, point, of, view, of, soviet, union?, for, example, image, of, a, general, de, gaulle, europe, of, fatherlands, countries, with, decisions, being, made, on, a, national, level, or, a, united, states, of, europe, with, common, decision, being, made, among, them?, gorbachev, first, of, all, you, can, probably, guess, that, everything, that, happens, in, europe, --, in, world, --, we, have, always, looked, towards, europe, for, everything, that, happens, in, europe, in, our, areas, --, don't, want, to, list, them, --, has, a, great, importance, for, developments, in, world, so, undoubtedly, and, noted, positive, developments, which, are, taking, place, in, europe, and, we, noted, support, of, documents, aimed, at, creating, a, new, europe, and, we, see, that, soviet, union, and, u, s, must, participate, very, actively, in, building, a, new, europe, all, of, this, has, existed, and, continues, to, exist, and, we, feel, a, responsibility, to, do, this, but, you, asked, question, about, how, think, perhaps, you, are, a, little, hasty, because, when, we, are, creating, a, certain, schematic, and, then, try, to, impose, then, we, get, one, result, when, a, process, is, being, developed, in, a, logical, way, within, helsinki, process, a, political, process, of, choice, then, we, find, that, new, forms, of,

You bet Nothing hurts me more than to meet with soldiers home from Persian Gulf who can't find a job or workers who have a job but worry that next day will bring a pink slip And what about parents who scrape and struggle to send their kids to college only to find them back living at home because they can't get work The world is in transition and we are feeling that transition in our homes The defining challenge of nineties is to win economic competition to win peace We must be a military superpower an economic superpower and an export superpower In this election you'll hear two versions of how to do this Theirs is to look inward and protect what we already have Ours is to look forward to open new markets prepare our people to compete to restore our social fabric to save and invest so we can win We believe that now that world looks more like America it's time for America to look more like herself And so we offer a philosophy that puts faith in individual not bureaucracy; a philosophy that empowers people to do their best so America can be at its best In a world that is safer and freer this is how we will build an America that is stronger safer and more secure We start with a simple fact Government is too big and spends too much have asked Congress to put a lid on mandatory spending except Social Security I've proposed doing away with over 200 programs and 4 000 wasteful projects and to freeze all other spending The gridlock Democrat Congress said no Audience members Boo - o - o!The So beginning tonight will enforce spending freeze on my own If Congress sends me a bill spending more than asked for in my budget will veto fast veto fast faster than copies of Millie's book sold Now Congress won't cut spending but refuses to give power to eliminate pork-barrel projects that waste your money Forty-three Governors have that power So ask you American people Give me a Congress that will give me line-item veto Let me tell you about a recent battle fought with Congress a battle in which was aided by Bob Michel and his troops and Bob Dole and his This spring worked day and night to get two-thirds of House Members to approve a balanced budget amendment to Constitution We almost had but we lost by just nine votes Now listen how Just before vote liberal leaders of Congress convinced 12 Members who cosponsored bill to switch sides and vote no Keep in mind they voted against a bill they had already put their names on Something fishy is going on And look at my opponent on this issue Look at my opponent He says he's for balanced budgets But he came out against amendment He's like that on a lot of issues first on one side then other He's been spotted in more places than Elvis Presley After all these years Congress has become pretty creative at finding ways to waste your money So we need to be just as creative at finding ways to stop them have a brandnew idea Taxpayers should be given right to check a box on their tax returns so that up to 10 percent of their payments can go for one purpose alone to reduce national debt But we also need to make sure that Congress doesn't just turn around and borrow more money to spend more money So will require that for every tax dollar set aside to cut debt ceilings on spending will be cut by an equal amount That way we will cut both debt and spending and take a whack out of budget defic My feelings about big government come from my experience; spent half my adult life in private sector My opponent has a different experience; he's been in government nearly all his life His passion to expand government knows no bounds He's already proposed and listen to this carefully he has already proposed $220 billion in new spending along with biggest tax increase in history $150 billion And that's just to start Audience members Boo-o-o!The He says he wants to tax rich But folks he defines rich as anyone who has a job Laughter You've heard of separations of powers Well my opponent practices a different theory power of separations Government has power to separate you from your wallet Laughter Now let me say this When comes to taxes I've learned hard way There's an old saying ``Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment '' Two years ago made a bad call on Democrats tax increase underestimated Congress' addiction to taxes With my back against wall agreed to a hard bargain One tax increase one time in return for toughest spending limits ever Well was a mistake to go along with Democratic tax increase and adm But here's question for American people Who do you trust in this election? The candidate who's raised taxes one time and regrets or other candidate who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed every time?Audience members Viva Bush! Viva Bush! Viva Bush!The very much Audience members H'em again! H'em again harder harder! H'em again! H'em again harder harder!The When new Congress convenes next January will propose to further reduce taxes across board provided we pay for these cuts with specific spending reductions that consider appropriate so that we do not increase defic will also continue to fight to increase personal exemption and to create jobs by winning a cut in capital gains taxes That will especially help small businesses You know they create -- small businesses -- they create two-thirds of new jobs in America But my opponent's plan for small business is clear present and dangerous Beside new income taxes his plan will lead to a new payroll tax to pay for a Government takeover of health care and another new tax to pay for training That is just beginning If he gets his way hardware stores across America will have a new sign up ``Closed for despair '' guess you'd say his plan really is ``Elvis economics '' America will be checking into ``Heartbreak Hotel '' believe that small business needs relief from taxation regulation and litigation And thus will extend for one year freeze on paperwork and unnecessary Federal regulation that imposed last winter There is no reason that Federal regulations should live longer than my friend George Burns will issue an order to get rid of any rule whose time has come and gone see something happening in our towns and in our neighborhoods Sharp lawyers are running wild Doctors are afraid to practice medicine and some moms and pops won't even coach Little League any more We must sue each other less and care for each other more am fighting to reform our legal system to put an end to crazy lawsuits If that means climbing into ring with trial lawyers well let me just say round one starts tonight After all my opponent's campaign is being backed by practically every trial lawyer who ever wore a tasselled loafer He's not in ring with them; he's in tank There are other things we need to do to get our economy up to speed prepare our kids for next century We must have new incentives for research and new training for workers Small businesses need capital and cred and defense workers need new jobs have a plan to provide affordable health care for every American controlling costs by cutting paperwork and lawsuits and expanding coverage to poorest of poor We do not need my opponent's plan for a massive Government takeover of health care which would ration care and deny you right to choose a doctor Who wants health care with a system with efficiency of House post office and compassion of KGB?What about our schools? What about our schools? My opponent and both want to change way our kids learn He wants to change our schools a little b and want to change them a lot Take issue of whether parents should be able to choose best school for their kids My opponent says that's okay as long as school is run by government And say every parent and child should have a real choice of schools public private or religious So we have a clear choice to fix our problems Do we turn to tattered blanket of bureaucracy that other nations are tossing away? Or do we give our people freedom and incentives to build security for themselves?Here's what I'm fighting for Open markets for American products; lower Government spending; tax relief; opportunities for small business; legal and health reform; job training; and new schools built on competition ready for 21st century Now okay why are these proposals not in effect today? Only one reason gridlock Democratic Congress Audience members Clean your House! Clean your House! Clean your House!The A very good idea a very good idea Now know Americans are tired of blame game tired of people in Washington acting like they're candidates for next episode of ``American Gladiators '' don't like either Neither should you But truth is truth Our policies have not failed They haven't even been tried Americans want jobs and on January 28th put before Congress a plan to create jobs If it'd been passed back then 500 000 more Americans would be at work right now But in a Nation that demands action Congress has become master of inaction It wasn't always this way heard Ford tonight served in Congress 22 years ago under him And back then we cooperated We didn't get personal We put people above everything else Heck we didn't even own blow dryers back in those days At my first Inauguration said that people didn't send us to bicker extended my hand and think American people know this extended my hand to congressional leaders Democratic leaders and they b The House leadership has not changed in 38 years It is a body caught in a hopelessly tangled web of PAC's perks privileges partnership and paralysis Every day Congress puts politics ahead of principle and above progress Now let me give you just one example February 20th 1991 It was at height of Gulf war On that very same day asked American pilots to risk their lives to fly missions over Baghdad also wanted to strengthen our economic security for future So that very same day introduced a new domestic energy strategy which would cut our dependence on foreign oil by 7 million barrels a day How many days did take to win Gulf war? Forty-three How many did take Congress to pass a national energy strategy? Five hundred and thirty-two and still counting have ridden stationary bikes that can move faster than United States House of Representatives and United States Senate controlled by Democrat leadership Audience members H'em again! H'em again harder harder! H'em again! H'em again harder harder!The Okay All right You wa I'm fixing to Where does my opponent stand with Congress? Well up in New York at their convention they kept congressional leaders away from podium hid them away They didn't want America to hear from people who really make decisions They hid them for a very good reason because American people would recognize a dangerous combination a rubber-check Congress and a rubber-stamp Governor Clinton and Congress know that you've caught on to their lingo They know when they say ``spending '' you say ``uh-oh '' So now they have a new word ``investment '' They want to ``invest'' $220 billion more of your money but want you to keep Governor Clinton and Congress want to put through largest tax increase in history but will not let that happen Governor Clinton and Congress don't want kids to have option of praying in school but do Clinton and Congress don't want to close legal loopholes and keep criminals behind bars but will Clinton and Congress will stock judiciary with liberal judges who write laws they can't get approved by voters Governor Clinton even says that Mario Cuomo belongs on Supreme Court Laughter Waa minute though No wa Maybe not a bad idea If you believe in judicial restraint you probably ought to be happy After all good Governor of New York can't make up his mind between chocolate and vanilla at Baskin Robbins He's there we won't have another court decision for 35 years and maybe that's all right too Are my opponent and Congress really in cahoots? Look at one important question Should we lim terms of Congress?Audience members Yes The Governor Clinton says no Congress says no say yes We tried this -- look we tried this once before combining Democratic Governor of a small southern State with a very liberal Vice and a Democratic Congress America does not need Carter I We do not want to take America back to those days of malaise But Americans want to know Where's proof that we will have better days in Washington?I'll give you 150 reasons That's how many Members of Congress are expected to leave Washington this year Some are tainted by scandal; voters have bounced them way they bounced their own checks But others are good Members Republican and Democrat and they agree with me The place just doesn't work anymore One hundred-fifty new Members from both parties will be coming to Washington this fall Every one will have a fresh view of America's future pledge today to American people immediately after this election will meet with every one of these Members before they get attacked by PAC's overwhelmed by their staffs and cornered by some camera crew will lay out my case for change change that matters real change that makes a difference change that is right for America You see there is a yearning in America a feeling that maybe it's time to get back to our roots Sure we must change but some values are timeless believe in families that stick together fathers who stick around happen to believe very deeply in worth of each individual human being born or unborn believe in teaching our kids difference between what's wrong and what's right teaching them respect for hard work and to love their neighbors believe that America will always have a special place in God's heart as long as He has a special place in ours Maybe that's why I've always believed that patriotism is not just another point of view There are times in every young person's life when God introduces you to yourself remember such a time It was back many years ago when stood watch at 4 a m up on bridge of a submarine United States Finback U S S Finback And would stand there and look out on blackness of sky broken only by sparkling stars above And would think about friends lost a country loved and about a girl named Barbara remember those nights as clearly as any in my life You know you can see things from up there that other people don't see You can see storm clouds rise and then disappear first hint of sun over horizon and first outline of shore far away Now know that Americans are uneasy today There is anxious talk around our kitchen tables But from where stand see not America's sunset but a sunrise The world changes for which we've sacrificed for a generation have finally come to pass and with them a rare and unprecedented opportunity to pass sweet cup of prosperity around our American table Are we up to it? know we are As travel our land meet veterans who once worked turrets of a tank and can now master keyboards of high-tech economy see teachers blessed with incredible American capacity for innovation who are teaching our children a new way to learn for a new century meet parents some working two jobs with hectic schedules who still find new ways to teach old values to steady their kids in a turbulent world take heart from what is happening in America not from those who profess a new passion for government but from those with an old and enduring faith in human potential those who understand that genius of America is our capacity for rebirth and renewal America is land where sun is always peeking over horizon Tonight appeal to that unyielding undying undeniable American spir ask you to consider now that entire world is moving our way why would we want to go back their way? ask not just for your support for my agenda but for your commitment to renew and rebuild our Nation by shaking up one institution that has withstood change for over four decades Join me in rolling away roadblock at other end of Pennsylvania Avenue so that in next 4 years we will match our accomplishments outside by building a stronger safer more secure America inside Forty-four years ago in another age of uncertainty a different embarked on a similar mission His name was Harry S Truman As he stood before his party to accept their nomination Harry Truman knew freedom know this evening freedom to talk about what's right for America and let chips fall where they may Harry Truman said this This is more than a political call to arms Give me your help not to win votes alone but to win this new crusade and keep America safe and secure for its own people Well tonight say to you Join me in our new crusade to reap rewards of our global victory to win peace so that we may make America safer and stronger

you, all, way, ''audience, members, boo-o-o!the, you, know, their, behavior, reminds, me, of, old, con, man's, advice, to, new, kid, he, said, ``son, if, you're, being, run, out, of, town, just, get, out, in, front, and, make, look, like, a, parade, ''well, make, no, mistake, the, demise, of, communism, wasn't, a, sure, thing, it, took, strong, leadership, of, presidents, from, both, parties, including, republicans, like, richard, nixon, and, gerald, ford, and, ronald, reagan, without, their, vision, and, support, of, american, people, soviet, union, would, be, a, strong, superpower, today, and, we'd, be, facing, a, nuclear, threat, tonight, my, opponents, say, spend, too, much, time, on, foreign, policy, as, if, didn't, matter, that, schoolchildren, once, hid, under, their, desks, in, drills, to, prepare, for, nuclear, war, saw, chance, to, rid, our, children's, dreams, of, nuclear, nightmare, and, did, over, past, 4, years, more, people, have, breathed, fresh, air, of, freedom, than, in, all, of, human, history, saw, a, chance, to, help, and, did, these, were, two, defining, opportunities, not, of, a, year, not, of, a, decade, but, of, an, entire, span, of, human, history, seized, those, opportunities, for, our, kids, and, our, grandkids, and, make, no, apologies, for, that, now, soviet, bear, may, be, gone, but, there, are, still, wolves, in, woods, we, saw, that, when, saddam, hussein, invaded, kuwa, the, mideast, might, have, become, a, nuclear, powder, keg, our, energy, supplies, held, hostage, so, we, did, what, was, right, and, what, was, necessary, we, destroyed, a, threat, freed, a, people, and, locked, a, tyrant, in, prison, of, his, own, country, what, about, leader, of, arkansas, national, guard, man, who, hopes, to, be, commander, in, chief?, well, b, bullet, and, he, bhis, nails, listen, to, this, now, two, days, after, congress, followed, my, lead, my, opponent, said, this, and, quote, directly, ``, guess, would, have, voted, with, majority, if, was, a, close, vote, but, agree, with, arguments, minority, made, '', now, sounds, to, me, like, his, policy, can, be, summed, up, by, a, road, sign, he's, probably, seen, on, his, bus, tour, ``slippery, when, wet, ''look, this, is, serious, business, think, about, impact, of, our, foreign, policy, failures, last, time, democrats, controlled, both, ends, of, pennsylvania,

dangerous, weapons, to, be, controlled, and, destroyed, freedom's, fight, is, not, finished, look, forward, to, being, first, to, visa, free, democratic, cuba, who, will, lead, world, in, face, of, these, challenges?, not, my, opponent, in, his, acceptance, speech, he, devoted, just, 65, seconds, to, telling, us, about, world, then, he, said, that, america, was, and, quote, again, --, want, to, be, fair, and, factual, --, quote, being, ``ridiculed'', everywhere, well, tell, that, to, people, around, world, for, whom, america, is, still, a, dream, tell, that, to, leaders, around, world, from, whom, america, commands, respect, ridiculed?, tell, that, to, men, and, women, of, desert, storm, audience, members, u, s, a, !, u, s, a, !, u, s, a, !the, let, me, just, make, an, aside, comment, here, because, of, what, you've, been, reading, in, paper, this, is, a, political, year, but, there's, a, lot, of, danger, in, world, you, can, be, sure, will, never, let, politics, interfere, with, a, foreign, policy, decision, forget, election;, will, do, right, what, is, right, for, national, security, of, united, states, of, america, and, that, is, a, pledge, from, my, heart, fifty, years, ago, this, summer, was, 18, years, of, age, see, some, young, people, in, audience, tonight, and, remember, how, felt, in, those, days, believed, deeply, in, this, country, and, we, were, faced, with, a, world, war, so, made, a, decision, to, go, off, and, fight, a, battle, much, different, from, political, battles, was, scared, but, was, willing, was, young, but, was, ready, had, barely, lived, when, began, to, watch, men, die, began, to, see, special, place, of, america, in, world, began, to, see, even, then, that, world, would, become, a, much, smaller, place, and, faraway, places, could, become, more, and, more, like, america, fifty, years, later, after, change, of, almost, biblical, proportions, we, know, that, when, freedom, grows, america, grows, just, as, a, strong, america, means, a, safer, world, we, have, learned, that, a, safer, world, means, a, stronger, america, this, election, is, about, change, but, that's, not, unusual, because, american, revolution, is, never, ending, today, pace, of, change, is, accelerating, we, face, new, opportunities, and, new, challenges, the, question, is, who, do, you, trust, to, make, change, work, for, you?audience, members, george, bush!, george, bush!, george, bush!the, my, opponent, says, america, is, a, nation, in, decline, of, our, economy, he, says, we, are, somewhere, on, list, beneath, germany, heading, south, toward, sri, lanka, well, don't, let, anyone, tell, you, that, america, is, second-rate, especially, somebody, running, for, maybe, he, hasn't, heard, that, we, are, still, world's, largest, economy, no, other, nation, sells, more, outside, its, borders, the, germans, british, japanese, can't, touch, productivity, of, you, american, worker, and, american, farmer, my, opponent, won't, mention, that, he, won't, remind, you, that, interest, rates, are, lowest, they've, been, in, 20, years, and, millions, of, americans, have, refinanced, their, homes, you, just, won't, hear, that, inflation, thief, of, middle, class, has, been, locked, in, a, maximum, security, prison, you, don't, hear, much, about, this, good, news, because, media, also, tends, to, focus, only, on, bad, when, berlin, wall, fell, half, expected, to, see, a, headline, ``wall, falls, three, border, guards, lose, jobs, '', laughter, and, underneath, probably, says, ``clinton, blames, bush, '', laughter, you, don't, hear, a, lot, about, progress, in, america, so, let, me, tell, you, about, some, good, things, we've, done, together, just, two, weeks, ago, all, three, nations, of, north, america, agreed, to, trade, freely, from, manitoba, to, mexico, this, will, bring, good, jobs, to, main, street, u, s, a, we, passed, americans, with, disabilities, act, bringing, 43, million, people, into, economic, mainstream, must, say, it's, about, time, our, children, will, brea, easier, because, of, our, new, clean, air, pact, we, are, rebuilding, our, roads, providing, jobs, for, more, than, half, a, million, americans, we, passed, a, child, care, law, and, we, took, a, stand, for, family, values, by, saying, that, when, comes, to, raising, children, government, doesn't, know, best;, parents, know, best, have, fought, against, prejudice, and, anti-semitism, all, my, life, am, proud, that, we, strengthened, our, civil, rights, laws, and, we, did, without, resorting, to, quotas, one, more, thing, of, vital, importance, to, all, today, cocaine, use, has, fallen, by, 60, percent, among, young, people, to, teenagers, parents, and, volunteers, who, are, helping, us, battle, scourge, of, drugs, in, america, we, say, thank, you;, from, bottom, of, our, hearts, do, want, to, do, more?, you, bet, nothing, hurts, me, more, than, to, meet, with, soldiers, home, from, persian, gulf, who, can't, find, a, job, or, workers, who, have, a, job, but, worry, that, next, day, will, bring, a, pink, slip, and, what, about, parents, who, scrape, and, struggle, to, send, their, kids, to, college, only, to, find, them, back, living, at, home, because, they, can't, get, work, the, world, is, in, transition, and, we, are, feeling, that, transition, in, our, homes, the, defining, challenge, of, nineties, is, to, win, economic, competition, to, win, peace, we, must, be, a, military, superpower, an, economic, superpower, and, an, export, superpower, in, this, election, you'll, hear, two, versions, of, how, to, do, this, theirs, is, to, look, inward, and, protect, what, we, already, have, ours, is, to, look, forward, to, open, new, markets, prepare, our, people, to, compete, to, restore, our, social, fabric, to, save, and, invest, so, we, can, win, we, believe, that, now, that, world, looks, more, like, america, it's, time, for, america, to, look, more, like, herself, and, so, we, offer, a, philosophy, that, puts, faith, in, individual, not, bureaucracy;, a, philosophy, that, empowers, people, to, do, their, best, so, america, can, be, at, its, best, in, a, world, that, is, safer, and, freer, this, is, how, we, will, build, an, america, that, is, stronger, safer, and, more, secure, we, start, with, a, simple, fact, government, is, too, big, and, spends, too, much, have, asked, congress, to, put, a, lid, on, mandatory, spending, except, social, security, i've, proposed, doing, away, with, over, 200, programs, and, 4, 000, wasteful, projects, and, to, freeze, all, other, spending, the, gridlock, democrat, congress, said, no, audience, members, boo, -, o, -, o!the, so, beginning, tonight, will, enforce, spending, freeze, on, my, own, if, congress, sends, me, a, bill, spending, more, than, asked, for, in, my, budget, will, veto, fast, veto, fast, faster, than, copies, of, millie's, book, sold, now, congress, won't, cut, spending, but, refuses, to, give, power, to, eliminate, pork-barrel, projects, that, waste, your, money, forty-three, governors, have, that, power, so, ask, you, american, people, give, me, a, congress, that, will, give, me, line-item, veto, let, me, tell, you, about, a, recent, battle, fought, with, congress, a, battle, in, which, was, aided, by, bob, michel, and, his, troops, and, bob, dole, and, his, this, spring, worked, day, and, night, to, get, two-thirds, of, house, members, to, approve, a, balanced, budget, amendment, to, constitution, we, almost, had, but, we, lost, by, just, nine, votes, now, listen, how, just, before, vote, liberal, leaders, of, congress, convinced, 12, members, who, cosponsored, bill, to, switch, sides, and, vote, no, keep, in, mind, they, voted, against, a, bill, they, had, already, put, their, names, on, something, fishy, is, going, on, and, look, at, my, opponent, on, this, issue, look, at, my, opponent, he, says, he's, for, balanced, budgets, but, he, came, out, against, amendment, he's, like, that, on, a, lot, of, issues, first, on, one, side, then, other, he's, been, spotted, in, more, places, than, elvis, presley, after, all, these, years, congress, has, become, pretty, creative, at, finding, ways, to, waste, your, money, so, we, need, to, be, just, as, creative, at, finding, ways, to, stop, them, have, a, brandnew, idea, taxpayers, should, be, given, right, to, check, a, box, on, their, tax, returns, so, that, up, to, 10, percent, of, their, payments, can, go, for, one, purpose, alone, to, reduce, national, debt, but, we, also, need, to, make, sure, that, congress, doesn't, just, turn, around, and, borrow, more, money, to, spend, more, money, so, will, require, that, for, every, tax, dollar, set, aside, to, cut, debt, ceilings, on, spending, will, be, cut, by, an, equal, amount, that, way, we, will, cut, both, debt, and, spending, and, take, a, whack, out, of, budget, defic, my, feelings, about, big, government, come, from, my, experience;, spent, half, my, adult, life, in, private, sector, my, opponent, has, a, different, experience;, he's, been, in, government, nearly, all, his, life, his, passion, to, expand, government, knows, no, bounds, he's, already, proposed, and, listen, to, this, carefully, he, has, already, proposed, $220, billion, in, new, spending, along, with, biggest, tax, increase, in, history, $150, billion, and, that's, just, to, start, audience, members, boo-o-o!the, he, says, he, wants, to, tax, rich, but, folks, he, defines, rich, as, anyone, who, has, a, job, laughter, you've, heard, of, separations, of, powers, well, my, opponent, practices, a, different, theory, power, of, separations, government, has, power, to, separate, you, from, your, wallet, laughter, now, let, me, say, this, when, comes, to, taxes, i've, learned, hard, way, there's, an, old, saying, ``good, judgment, comes, from, experience, and, experience, comes, from, bad, judgment, '', two, years, ago, made, a, bad, call, on, democrats, tax, increase, underestimated, congress', addiction, to, taxes, with, my, back, against, wall, agreed, to, a, hard, bargain, one, tax, increase, one, time, in, return, for, toughest, spending, limits, ever, well, was, a, mistake, to, go, along, with, democratic, tax, increase, and, adm, but, here's, question, for, american, people, who, do, you, trust, in, this, election?, the, candidate, who's, raised, taxes, one, time, and, regrets, or, other, candidate, who, raised, taxes, and, fees, 128, times, and, enjoyed, every, time?audience, members, viva, bush!, viva, bush!, viva, bush!the, very, much, audience, members, h'em, again!, h'em, again, harder, harder!, h'em, again!, h'em, again, harder, harder!the, when, new, congress, convenes, next, january, will, propose, to, further, reduce, taxes, across, board, provided, we, pay, for, these, cuts, with, specific, spending, reductions, that, consider, appropriate, so, that, we, do, not, increase, defic, will, also, continue, to, fight, to, increase, personal, exemption, and, to, create, jobs, by, winning, a, cut, in, capital, gains, taxes, that, will, especially, help, small, businesses, you, know, they, create, --, small, businesses, --, they, create, two-thirds, of, new, jobs, in, america, but, my, opponent's, plan, for, small, business, is, clear, present, and, dangerous, beside, new, income, taxes, his, plan, will, lead, to, a, new, payroll, tax, to, pay, for, a, government, takeover, of, health, care, and, another, new, tax, to, pay, for, training, that, is, just, beginning, if, he, gets, his, way, hardware, stores, across, america, will, have, a, new, sign, up, ``closed, for, despair, '', guess, you'd, say, his, plan, really, is, ``elvis, economics, '', america, will, be, checking, into, ``heartbreak, hotel, '', believe, that, small, business, needs, relief, from, taxation, regulation, and, litigation, and, thus, will, extend, for, one, year, freeze, on, paperwork, and, unnecessary, federal, regulation, that, imposed, last, winter, there, is, no, reason, that, federal, regulations, should, live, longer, than, my, friend, george, burns, will, issue, an, order, to, get, rid, of, any, rule, whose, time, has, come, and, gone, see, something, happening, in, our, towns, and, in, our, neighborhoods, sharp, lawyers, are, running, wild, doctors, are, afraid, to, practice, medicine, and, some, moms, and, pops, won't, even, coach, little, league, any, more, we, must, sue, each, other, less, and, care, for, each, other, more, am, fighting, to, reform, our, legal, system, to, put, an, end, to, crazy, lawsuits, if, that, means, climbing, into, ring, with, trial, lawyers, well, let, me, just, say, round, one, starts, tonight, after, all, my, opponent's, campaign, is, being, backed, by, practically, every, trial, lawyer, who, ever, wore, a, tasselled, loafer, he's, not, in, ring, with, them;, he's, in, tank, there, are, other, things, we, need, to, do, to, get, our, economy, up, to, speed, prepare, our, kids, for, next, century, we, must, have, new, incentives, for, research, and, new, training, for, workers, small, businesses, need, capital, and, cred, and, defense, workers, need, new, jobs, have, a, plan, to, provide, affordable, health, care, for, every, american, controlling, costs, by, cutting, paperwork, and, lawsuits, and, expanding, coverage, to, poorest, of, poor, we, do, not, need, my, opponent's, plan, for, a, massive, government, takeover, of, health, care, which, would, ration, care, and, deny, you, right, to, choose, a, doctor, who, wants, health, care, with, a, system, with, efficiency, of, house, post, office, and, compassion, of, kgb?what, about, our, schools?, what, about, our, schools?, my, opponent, and, both, want, to, change, way, our, kids, learn, he, wants, to, change, our, schools, a, little, b, and, want, to, change, them, a, lot, take, issue, of, whether, parents, should, be, able, to, choose, best, school, for, their, kids, my, opponent, says, that's, okay, as, long, as, school, is, run, by, government, and, say, every, parent, and, child, should, have, a, real, choice, of, schools, public, private, or, religious, so, we, have, a, clear, choice, to, fix, our, problems, do, we, turn, to, tattered, blanket, of, bureaucracy, that, other, nations, are, tossing, away?, or, do, we, give, our, people, freedom, and, incentives, to, build, security, for, themselves?here's, what, i'm, fighting, for, open, markets, for, american, products;, lower, government, spending;, tax, relief;, opportunities, for, small, business;, legal, and, health, reform;, job, training;, and, new, schools, built, on, competition, ready, for, 21st, century, now, okay, why, are, these, proposals, not, in, effect, today?, only, one, reason, gridlock, democratic, congress, audience, members, clean, your, house!, clean, your, house!, clean, your, house!the, a, very, good, idea, a, very, good, idea, now, know, americans, are, tired, of, blame, game, tired, of, people, in, washington, acting, like, they're, candidates, for, next, episode, of, ``american, gladiators, '', don't, like, either, neither, should, you, but, truth, is, truth, our, policies, have, not, failed, they, haven't, even, been, tried, americans, want, jobs, and, on, january, 28th, put, before, congress, a, plan, to, create, jobs, if, it'd, been, passed, back, then, 500, 000, more, americans, would, be, at, work, right, now, but, in, a, nation, that, demands, action, congress, has, become, master, of, inaction, it, wasn't, always, this, way, heard, ford, tonight, served, in, congress, 22, years, ago, under, him, and, back, then, we, cooperated, we, didn't, get, personal, we, put, people, above, everything, else, heck, we, didn't, even, own, blow, dryers, back, in, those, days, at, my, first, inauguration, said, that, people, didn't, send, us, to, bicker, extended, my, hand, and, think, american, people, know, this, extended, my, hand, to, congressional, leaders, democratic, leaders, and, they, b, the, house, leadership, has, not, changed, in, 38, years, it, is, a, body, caught, in, a, hopelessly, tangled, web, of, pac's, perks, privileges, partnership, and, paralysis, every, day, congress, puts, politics, ahead, of, principle, and, above, progress, now, let, me, give, you, just, one, example, february, 20th, 1991, it, was, at, height, of, gulf, war, on, that, very, same, day, asked, american, pilots, to, risk, their, lives, to, fly, missions, over, baghdad, also, wanted, to, strengthen, our, economic, security, for, future, so, that, very, same, day, introduced, a, new, domestic, energy, strategy, which, would, cut, our, dependence, on, foreign, oil, by, 7, million, barrels, a, day, how, many, days, did, take, to, win, gulf, war?, forty-three, how, many, did, take, congress, to, pass, a, national, energy, strategy?, five, hundred, and, thirty-two, and, still, counting, have, ridden, stationary, bikes, that, can, move, faster, than, united, states, house, of, representatives, and, united, states, senate, controlled, by, democrat, leadership, audience, members, h'em, again!, h'em, again, harder, harder!, h'em, again!, h'em, again, harder, harder!the, okay, all, right, you, wa, i'm, fixing, to, where, does, my, opponent, stand, with, congress?, well, up, in, new, york, at, their, convention, they, kept, congressional, leaders, away, from, podium, hid, them, away, they, didn't, want, america, to, hear, from, people, who, really, make, decisions, they, hid, them, for, a, very, good, reason, because, american, people, would, recognize, a, dangerous, combination, a, rubber-check, congress, and, a, rubber-stamp, governor, clinton, and, congress, know, that, you've, caught, on, to, their, lingo, they, know, when, they, say, ``spending, '', you, say, ``uh-oh, '', so, now, they, have, a, new, word, ``investment, '', they, want, to, ``invest'', $220, billion, more, of, your, money, but, want, you, to, keep, governor, clinton, and, congress, want, to, put, through, largest, tax, increase, in, history, but, will, not, let, that, happen, governor, clinton, and, congress, don't, want, kids, to, have, option, of, praying, in, school, but, do, clinton, and, congress, don't, want, to, close, legal, loopholes, and, keep, criminals, behind, bars, but, will, clinton, and, congress, will, stock, judiciary, with, liberal, judges, who, write, laws, they, can't, get, approved, by, voters, governor, clinton, even, says, that, mario, cuomo, belongs, on, supreme, court, laughter, waa, minute, though, no, wa, maybe, not, a, bad, idea, if, you, believe, in, judicial, restraint, you, probably, ought, to, be, happy, after, all, good, governor, of, new, york, can't, make, up, his, mind, between, chocolate, and, vanilla, at, baskin, robbins, he's, there, we, won't, have, another, court, decision, for, 35, years, and, maybe, that's, all, right, too, are, my, opponent, and, congress, really, in, cahoots?, look, at, one, important, question, should, we, lim, terms, of, congress?audience, members, yes, the, governor, clinton, says, no, congress, says, no, say, yes, we, tried, this, --, look, we, tried, this, once, before, combining, democratic, governor, of, a, small, southern, state, with, a, very, liberal, vice, and, a, democratic, congress, america, does, not, need, carter, i, we, do, not, want, to, take, america, back, to, those, days, of, malaise, but, americans, want, to, know, where's, proof, that, we, will, have, better, days, in, washington?i'll, give, you, 150, reasons, that's, how, many, members, of, congress, are, expected, to, leave, washington, this, year, some, are, tainted, by, scandal;, voters, have, bounced, them, way, they, bounced, their, own, checks, but, others, are, good, members, republican, and, democrat, and, they, agree, with, me, the, place, just, doesn't, work, anymore, one, hundred-fifty, new, members, from, both, parties, will, be, coming, to, washington, this, fall, every, one, will, have, a, fresh, view, of, america's, future, pledge, today, to, american, people, immediately, after, this, election, will, meet, with, every, one, of, these, members, before, they, get, attacked, by, pac's, overwhelmed, by, their, staffs, and, cornered, by, some, camera, crew, will, lay, out, my, case, for, change, change, that, matters, real, change, that, makes, a, difference, change, that, is, right, for, america, you, see, there, is, a, yearning, in, america, a, feeling, that, maybe, it's, time, to, get, back, to, our, roots, sure, we, must, change, but, some, values, are, timeless, believe, in, families, that, stick, together, fathers, who, stick, around, happen, to, believe, very, deeply, in, worth, of, each, individual, human, being, born, or, unborn, believe, in, teaching, our, kids, difference, between, what's, wrong, and, what's, right, teaching, them, respect, for, hard, work, and, to, love, their, neighbors, believe, that, america, will, always, have, a, special, place, in, god's, heart, as, long, as, he, has, a, special, place, in, ours, maybe, that's, why, i've, always, believed, that, patriotism, is, not, just, another, point, of, view, there, are, times, in, every, young, person's, life, when, god, introduces, you, to, yourself, remember, such, a, time, it, was, back, many, years, ago, when, stood, watch, at, 4, a, m, up, on, bridge, of, a, submarine, united, states, finback, u, s, s, finback, and, would, stand, there, and, look, out, on, blackness, of, sky, broken, only, by, sparkling, stars, above, and, would, think, about, friends, lost, a, country, loved, and, about, a, girl, named, barbara, remember, those, nights, as, clearly, as, any, in, my, life, you, know, you, can, see,

wanted to make sure would be a big h but couldn't convince Barbara to deliver for me see and Vice are laughing They saw what did in Japan and they're just happy they're sitting behind me mean to speak tonight of big things of big changes and promises they hold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them and move our country forward as undisputed leader of age We gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in history of man on Earth For in past 12 months world has known changes of almost biblical proportions And even now months after failed coup that doomed a failed system I'm not sure we've absorbed full impact full import of what happened But communism died this year Even as with most fascinating possible vantage point there were times when was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that didn't always show joy that was in my heart But biggest thing that has happened in world in my life in our lives is this By grace of God America won Cold War mean to speak this evening of changes that can take place in our country now that we can stop making sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right will speak of those things But let me tell you something I've been thinking these past few months It's a kind of rollcall of honor For Cold War didn't end; was won And think of those who won in places like Korea and Vietnam And some of them didn't come back Back then they were heroes but this year they were victors The long rollcall all G Joes and Janes all ones who fought faithfully for freedom who h ground and sucked dust and knew their share of horror This may seem frivolous and don't mean so but it's moving to me how world saw them The world saw not only their special valor but their special style their rambunctious optimistic bravery their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region What a group we've put forth for generations now from ones who wrote \"\"Kilroy was here\"\" on walls of German stalags to those who left signs in Iraqi desert that said \"\" saw Elvis \"\" What a group of kids we've sent out into world And there's another to be singled out though may seem inelegant and mean a mass of people called American taxpayer No one ever thinks to thank people who pay a country's bill or an alliance's bill But for half a century now American people have shouldered burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than would have been if imperial communism had never existed But did; doesn't anymore And here's a fact wouldn't mind world acknowledging The American taxpayer bore brunt of burden and deserves a hunk of glory So now for first time in 35 years our strategic bombers stand down No longer are they on 'round-the-clock alert Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow And they won't have as my children did air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war My grandchildren don't have to do that and won't have bad dreams children had once in decades past There are still threats But long drawn-out dread is over A year ago tonight spoke to you at a moment of high peril American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm And after 40 days in desert skies and four days on ground men and women of America's armed forces and our allies accomplished goals that declared and that you endorsed We liberated Kuwa Soon after Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace an historic first And soon after that at Christmas last American hostages came home Our policies were vindicated Much good can come from prudent use of power And much good can come of this A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power United States of America And they regard this with no dread For world trusts us with power and world is right They trust us to be fair and restrained They trust us to be on side of decency They trust us to do what's right use those words advisedly A few days after war began received a telegram from Joanne Speicher wife of first pilot killed in Gulf Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher Even in her grief she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough she would tell them \"\"that their father went away to war because was right thing to do \"\" And she said all It was right thing to do And we did together There were honest differences right here in this chamber But when war began you put partisanship aside and we supported our troops This is still a time for pride but this is no time to boast For problems face us and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down Two years ago began planning cuts in military spending that reflected changes of new era But now this year with imperial communism gone that process can be accelerated Tonight can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force These are actions we are taking on our own because they are right thing to do After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement we will shut down further production of B-2 bombers We will cancel small ICBM program We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles We will stop all new production of Peacekeeper missile And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles This weekend will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of Russian Federation I've informed Yeltsin that if Commonwealth former Soviet Union will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles will do following We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles We will reduce number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use Yeltsin's early response has been very positive and expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful want you to know that for half a century American Presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words But even in midst of celebration we must keep caution as a friend For world is still a dangerous place Only dead have seen end of conflict And though yesterday's challenges are behind us tomorrow's are being born The Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with Joint Chiefs of Staff And make them with confidence But do not misunderstand me The reductions have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over next five years By 1997 we will have cut defense by 30 percent since took office These cuts are deep and you must know my resolve This deep and no deeper To do less would be insensible to progress but to do more would be ignorant of history We must not go back to days of \"\" hollow army \"\" We cannot repeat mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if world were permanently safe remind you this evening that have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms And urge you again to pass Strategic Defense Initiative SD There are those who say that now we can turn away from world that we have no special role no special place But we are United States of America leader of West that has become leader of world And as long as am will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere not out of arrogance not out of altruism but for safety and security of our children This is a fact Strength in pursuof peace is no vice; isolationism in pursuof security is no virtue And now to our troubles at home They're not all economic; primary problem is our economy There are some good signs Inflation that thief is down And interest rates are down But unemployment is too high some industries are in trouble and growth is not what should be Let me tell you right from start and right from heart know we're in hard times But know something else This will not stand In this chamber in this chamber we can bring same courage and sense of common purpose to economy that we brought to Desert Storm And we can defeat hard times together believe you'll help One reason is that you're patriots and you want best for your country And believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get job done because it's right thing to do The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea that people will do great things if only you set them free Well we're going to set economy free For if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything it's that if we can change world we can change America We must encourage investment We must make easier for people to invest money and create new products new industries and new jobs We must clear away obstacles to growth high taxes high regulation redtape and yes wasteful government spending None of this will happen with a snap of fingers but will happen And test of a plan isn't whether it's called new or dazzling The American people aren't impressed by gimmicks; they're smarter on this score than all of us in this room The only test of a plan is Is sound and will work?We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up economy And then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in world economy There are certain things that a can do without Congress and I'm going to do them have this evening asked major Cabinet departments and federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal regulations that could hinder growth In those 90 days major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations old and new to stop ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth Further for untold number of hard-working responsible American workers and business men and women who've been forced to go without needed bank loans banking credcrunch must end won't neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve public good but regulatory overkill must be stopped And I've instructed our government regulators to stop have directed Cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible This should put an extra $10 billion into economy in next six months And our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being And that means jobs building roads jobs building bridges and jobs building railways And have this evening directed Secretary of Treasury to change federal tax withholding tables With this change millions of Americans from whom government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have government withhold less from their paychecks Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one This initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over next 12 months money people can use to help pay for clothing college or to get a new car Finally working with Federal Reserve we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down Now these are things can do And now members of Congress let me tell you what you can do for your country You must pass other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery am proposing this evening a change in alternative minimum tax and creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work Real estate has led our economy out of almost all tough times we've ever had Once building starts carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages My plan would modify passive loss rule for active real estate developers And would make easier for pension plans to purchase real estate For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't quite afford my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from IRAs without penalty and provide a $5 000 tax credfor first purchase of that home And finally my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment This time at this hour cannot take no for an answer You must cut capital gains tax on people of our country Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents But demagogs are wrong They are wrong and they know Sixty percent of people who beneffrom lower capital gains have incomes under $50 000 A cut in capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country And so I'm asking you to cut capital gains tax to a maximum of 15 4 percent I'll tell you those of you who say \"\"Oh no someone who's comfortable may beneffrom that \"\" you kind of remind me of old definition of Puritan who couldn't sleep at night worrying that somehow someone somewhere was out having a good time Laughter The opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something When they aim at big guy they usually h little guy And maybe it's time that stopped This then is my short-term plan Your part members of Congress requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on economy without breaking budget agreement and without raising tax rates While my plan is being passed and kicking in we've got to care for those in trouble today have provided for up to $4 4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits And ask for congressional action right away And thank committee Applause Well at last Let's be frank Let's be frank Let me level with you know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season Laughter know and you know that everything propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms But ask you to know what is in my heart And my aim is to increase our nation's good I'm doing what think is right and am proposing what know will help pride myself that I'm a prudent man and believe that patience is a virtue But understand that politics is for some a game and that sometimes game is to stop all progress and then decry lack of improvement Laughter But let me tell you Far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is well-being of our country Members of this chamber are practical people and know you won't resent some practical advice When people put their party's fortunes whatever party whatever side of this aisle before public good they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves And they will certainly deserve submmy plan tomorrow and I'm asking you to pass by March 20 And ask American people to let you know they want this action by March 20 From day after that if must be battle is joined And you know when principle is at stake relish a good fair fight said my plan has two parts and does And it's second part that is heart of matter For it's not enough to get an immediate burst We need long-term improvement in our economic position We all know that key to our economic future is to ensure that America continues as an economic leader of world We have that in our power Here then is my long-term plan to guarantee our future First trade We will work to break down walls that stop world trade We will work to open markets everywhere And in our major trade negotiations will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers And we'll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through North American free trade agreement and through Enterprise for Americas Initiative But changes are here and more are coming The workplace of future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever more people who are computer-literate highly educated We must be world's leader in education And we must revolutionize America's schools My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal My plan will give parents more choice give teachers more flexibility and help communities create new American schools Thirty states across nation have established America 2000 programs Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in Now Congress must join this great movement Pass my proposals for new American schools That was my second long-term proposal and here's my third We must make commonsense investments that will help us compete long-term in marketplace We must encourage research and development My plan is to make R and D tax credpermanent and to provide record levels of support over $76 billion this year alone for people who will explore promise of emerging technologies Fourth we must do something about crime and drugs It is time for a major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in morning on a subway deserves right to get there safely And surely it's true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in parks they pay for surely these people have been denied a basic civil right It is time to restore Congress pass my comprehensive crime bill It is tough on criminals and supportive of police and has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now Pass Help your country Fifth ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into inner city We must empower poor with pride that comes from owning a home getting a job becoming a part of things My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing And ask tonight for record expenditures for program that helps children born into want move into excellence Head Start Step six we must reform our health care system For this too bears on whether or not we can compete in world American health costs have been exploding This year America will spend over $800 billion on health and that is expected to grow to $1 6 trillion by end of decade We simply cannot afford this The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in price of everything we buy and everything we sell When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars cost goes into products he makes and you pay bill We must make a choice Now some pretend we can have both ways They call \"\"play or pay \"\" but that expensive approach is unstable It will mean higher taxes fewer jobs and eventually a system under complete government control Really there are only two options And we can move toward a nationalized system a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force government to ration services arbitrarily And what we'll get is patients in long lines indifferent service and a huge new tax burden Or we can reform our own private health care system which still gives us for all its flaws best quality health care in world Well let's build on our strengths My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing idea of choice We make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered and we do by providing a health insurance tax credof up to $3 750 for each low-income family And middle class gets help too And by reforming health insurance market my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems We must bring costs under control preserve quality preserve choice and reduce people's nagging daily worry about health insurance My plan details of which I'll announce very shortly does just that Seventh we must get federal deficunder control We now have in law enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for programs we create There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now But cannot let them do and won't My plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which means no more next year than this year will not tamper with Social Security but would put real caps on growth of uncontrolled spending And would also freeze federal domestic government employment And with help of Congress my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve federal funding Some of them have noble titles but none of them is indispensable We can get rid of each and every one of them You know it's time we rediscovered a home truth American people have never forgotten This government is too big and spends too much And call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to annual ritual of filling budget with pork barrel appropriations Every year press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples a Lawrence Welk museum research grants for Belgian endive We all know how these things get into budget and maybe you need someone to help you say no know how to say and know what need to make stick Give me same thing 43 Governors have line-item veto and let me help you control spending We must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandates These are requirements Congress puts on our cities counties and states without supplying money If Congress passes a mandate should be forced to pay for and balance cost with savings elsewhere After all a mandate just increases someone else's burden and that means higher taxes at state and local level Step eight Congress should enact bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action bank reform civil justice reform tort reform and my national energy strategy And finally we must strengthen family because is family that has greatest bearing on our future When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children she's saying to every person in this country Family matters And am announcing tonight a new Commission on America's Urban Families I've asked Missouri's Governor John Ashcroft to be Chairman former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be Cochair You know had mayors leading mayors from League of Cities in other day at White House and they told me something striking They said that every one of them Republican or Democrat agreed on one thing that major cause of problems of cities is dissolution of family They asked for this Commission and they were right to ask because it's time to determine what we can do to keep families together strong and sound There's one thing we can do right away Ease burden of rearing a child ask you tonight to raise personal exemption by $500 per child for every family For a family with four kids that's an increase of $2 000 This is a good start in right direction and it's what we can afford It's time to allow families to deduct interest they pay on student loans am asking you to do just that And I'm asking you to allow people to use money from their IRAs to pay medical and education expenses all without penalties And I'm asking for more Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country and chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare Americans are most generous people on Earth But we have to go back to insight of Franklin Roosevelt who when he spoke of what became welfare program warned that must not become \"\"a narcotic\"\" and a \"\"subtle destroyer\"\" of spir Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle It was never meant to be a hab It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy It's time to replace assumptions of welfare state and help reform welfare system States throughout country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive government assistance they have responsibilities to taxpayer A responsibility to seek work education or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey law We are going to help this movement Often state reform requires waiving certain federal regulations will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks for our help want to add as we make these changes we work together to improve this system that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing If you read papers and watch TV you know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness racist comments anti-Semitism an increased sense of division Really this is not us This is not who we are And this is not acceptable And so you have my plan for America And I'm asking for big things but believe in my heart you'll do what's right You know it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions myself have sometimes thought aging process could be delayed if had to make its way through Congress Laughter You will deliberate and you will discuss and that is fine But my friends people cannot wa They need help now There's a mood among us People are worried There's been talk of decline Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired And thought Really? You go tell Neil Armstrong standing on moon Tell men and women who put him there Tell American farmer who feeds his country and world Tell men and women of Desert Storm Moods come and go but greatness endures Ours does And maybe for a moment it's good to remember what in dailiness of our lives we forget We are still and ever freest nation on Earth kindest nation on Earth strongest nation on Earth And we have always risen to occasion And we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day and those who would stop us had better step aside Because look at hard times and make this vow This will not stand And so we move on together a rising nation once and future miracle that is still this night hope of world God bless you and God bless our beloved country very very much\"

troops, this, is, still, a, time, for, pride, but, this, is, no, time, to, boast, for, problems, face, us, and, we, must, stand, together, once, again, and, solve, them, and, not, let, our, country, down, two, years, ago, began, planning, cuts, in, military, spending, that, reflected, changes, of, new, era, but, now, this, year, with, imperial, communism, gone, that, process, can, be, accelerated, tonight, can, tell, you, of, dramatic, changes, in, our, strategic, nuclear, force, these, are, actions, we, are, taking, on, our, own, because, they, are, right, thing, to, do, after, completing, 20, planes, for, which, we, have, begun, procurement, we, will, shut, down, further, production, of, b-2, bombers, we, will, cancel, small, icbm, program, we, will, cease, production, of, new, warheads, for, our, sea-based, ballistic, missiles, we, will, stop, all, new, production, of, peacekeeper, missile, and, we, will, not, purchase, any, more, advanced, cruise, missiles, this, weekend, will, meet, at, camp, david, with, boris, yeltsin, of, russian, federation, i've, informed, yeltsin, that, if, commonwealth, former, soviet, union, will, eliminate, all, land-based, multiple-warhead, ballistic, missiles, will, do, following, we, will, eliminate, all, peacekeeper, missiles, we, will, reduce, number, of, warheads, on, minuteman, missiles, to, one, and, reduce, number, of, warheads, on, our, sea-based, missiles, by, about, one-third, and, we, will, convert, a, substantial, portion, of, our, strategic, bombers, to, primarily, conventional, use, yeltsin's, early, response, has, been, very, positive, and, expect, our, talks, at, camp, david, to, be, fruitful, want, you, to, know, that, for, half, a, century, american, presidents, have, longed, to, make, such, decisions, and, say, such, words, but, even, in, midst, of, celebration, we, must, keep, caution, as, a, friend, for, world, is, still, a, dangerous, place, only, dead, have, seen, end, of, conflict, and, though, yesterday's, challenges, are, behind, us, tomorrow's, are, being, born, the, secretary, of, defense, recommended, these, cuts, after, consultation, with, joint, chiefs, of, staff, and, make, them, with, confidence, but, do, not, misunderstand, me, the, reductions, have, approved, will, save, us, an, additional, $50, billion, over, next, five, years, by, 1997, we, will, have, cut, defense, by, 30, percent, since, took, office, these, cuts, are, deep, and, you, must, know, my, resolve, this, deep, and, no, deeper, to, do, less, would, be, insensible, to, progress, but, to, do, more, would, be, ignorant, of, history, we, must, not, go, back, to, days, of, \"\", hollow, army, \"\", we, cannot, repeat, mistakes, made, twice, in, this, century, when, armistice, was, followed, by, recklessness, and, defense, was, purged, as, if, world, were, permanently, safe, remind, you, this, evening, that, have, asked, for, your, support, in, funding, a, program, to, protect, our, country, from, limited, nuclear, missile, attack, we, must, have, this, protection, because, too, many, people, in, too, many, countries, have, access, to, nuclear, arms, and, urge, you, again, to, pass, strategic, defense, initiative, sd, there, are, those, who, say, that, now, we, can, turn, away, from, world, that, we, have, no, special, role, no, special, place, but, we, are, united, states, of, america, leader, of, west, that, has, become, leader, of, world, and, as, long, as, am, will, continue, to, lead, in, support, of, freedom, everywhere, not, out, of, arrogance, not, out, of, altruism, but, for, safety, and, security, of, our, children, this, is, a, fact, strength, in, pursuof, peace, is, no, vice;, isolationism, in, pursuof, security, is, no, virtue, and, now, to, our, troubles, at, home, they're, not, all, economic;, primary, problem, is, our, economy, there, are, some, good, signs, inflation, that, thief, is, down, and, interest, rates, are, down, but, unemployment, is, too, high, some, industries, are, in, trouble, and, growth, is, not, what, should, be, let, me, tell, you, right, from, start, and, right, from, heart, know, we're, in, hard, times, but, know, something, else, this, will, not, stand, in, this, chamber, in, this, chamber, we, can, bring, same, courage, and, sense, of, common, purpose, to, economy, that, we, brought, to, desert, storm, and, we, can, defeat, hard, times, together, believe, you'll, help, one, reason, is, that, you're, patriots, and, you, want, best, for, your, country, and, believe, that, in, your, hearts, you, want, to, put, partisanship, aside, and, get, job, done, because, it's, right, thing, to, do, the, power, of, america, rests, in, a, stirring, but, simple, idea, that, people, will, do, great, things, if, only, you, set, them, free, well, we're, going, to, set, economy, free, for, if, this, age, of, miracles, and, wonders, has, taught, us, anything, it's, that, if, we, can, change, world, we, can, change, america, we, must, encourage, investment, we, must, make, easier, for, people, to, invest, money, and, create, new, products, new, industries, and, new, jobs, we, must, clear, away, obstacles, to, growth, high, taxes, high, regulation, redtape, and, yes, wasteful, government, spending, none, of, this, will, happen, with, a, snap, of, fingers, but, will, happen, and, test, of, a, plan, isn't, whether, it's, called, new, or, dazzling, the, american, people, aren't, impressed, by, gimmicks;, they're, smarter, on, this, score, than, all, of, us, in, this, room, the, only, test, of, a, plan, is, is, sound, and, will, work?we, must, have, a, short-term, plan, to, address, our, immediate, needs, and, heat, up, economy, and, then, we, need, a, longer, term, plan, to, keep, combustion, going, and, to, guarantee, our, place, in, world, economy, there, are, certain, things, that, a, can, do, without, congress, and, i'm, going, to, do, them, have, this, evening, asked, major, cabinet, departments, and, federal, agencies, to, institute, a, 90-day, moratorium, on, any, new, federal, regulations, that, could, hinder, growth, in, those, 90, days, major, departments, and, agencies, will, carry, out, a, top-to-bottom, review, of, all, regulations, old, and, new, to, stop, ones, that, will, hurt, growth, and, speed, up, those, that, will, help, growth, further, for, untold, number, of, hard-working, responsible, american, workers, and, business, men, and, women, who've, been, forced, to, go, without, needed, bank, loans, banking, credcrunch, must, end, won't, neglect, my, responsibility, for, sound, regulations, that, serve, public, good, but, regulatory, overkill, must, be, stopped, and, i've, instructed, our, government, regulators, to, stop, have, directed, cabinet, departments, and, federal, agencies, to, speed, up, progrowth, expenditures, as, quickly, as, possible, this, should, put, an, extra, $10, billion, into, economy, in, next, six, months, and, our, new, transportation, bill, provides, more, than, $150, billion, for, construction, and, maintenance, projects, that, are, vital, to, our, growth, and, well-being, and, that, means, jobs, building, roads, jobs, building, bridges, and, jobs, building, railways, and, have, this, evening, directed, secretary, of, treasury, to, change, federal, tax, withholding, tables, with, this, change, millions, of, americans, from, whom, government, withholds, more, than, necessary, can, now, choose, to, have, government, withhold, less, from, their, paychecks, something, tells, me, a, number, of, taxpayers, may, take, us, up, on, this, one, this, initiative, could, return, about, $25, billion, back, into, our, economy, over, next, 12, months, money, people, can, use, to, help, pay, for, clothing, college, or, to, get, a, new, car, finally, working, with, federal, reserve, we, will, continue, to, support, monetary, policy, that, keeps, both, interest, rates, and, inflation, down, now, these, are, things, can, do, and, now, members, of, congress, let, me, tell, you, what, you, can, do, for, your, country, you, must, pass, other, elements, of, my, plan, to, meet, our, economic, needs, everyone, knows, that, investment, spurs, recovery, am, proposing, this, evening, a, change, in, alternative, minimum, tax, and, creation, of, a, new, 15-percent, investment, tax, allowance, this, will, encourage, businesses, to, accelerate, investment, and, bring, people, back, to, work, real, estate, has, led, our, economy, out, of, almost, all, tough, times, we've, ever, had, once, building, starts, carpenters, and, plumbers, work;, people, buy, homes, and, take, out, mortgages, my, plan, would, modify, passive, loss, rule, for, active, real, estate, developers, and, would, make, easier, for, pension, plans, to, purchase, real, estate, for, those, americans, who, dream, of, buying, a, first, home, but, who, can't, quite, afford, my, plan, would, allow, first-time, homebuyers, to, withdraw, savings, from, iras, without, penalty, and, provide, a, $5, 000, tax, credfor, first, purchase, of, that, home, and, finally, my, immediate, plan, calls, on, congress, to, give, crucial, help, to, people, who, own, a, home, to, everyone, who, has, a, business, or, a, farm, or, a, single, investment, this, time, at, this, hour, cannot, take, no, for, an, answer, you, must, cut, capital, gains, tax, on, people, of, our, country, never, has, an, issue, been, more, demagogued, by, its, opponents, but, demagogs, are, wrong, they, are, wrong, and, they, know, sixty, percent, of, people, who, beneffrom, lower, capital, gains, have, incomes, under, $50, 000, a, cut, in, capital, gains, tax, increases, jobs, and, helps, just, about, everyone, in, our, country, and, so, i'm, asking, you, to, cut, capital, gains, tax, to, a, maximum, of, 15, 4, percent, i'll, tell, you, those, of, you, who, say, \"\"oh, no, someone, who's, comfortable, may, beneffrom, that, \"\", you, kind, of, remind, me, of, old, definition, of, puritan, who, couldn't, sleep, at, night, worrying, that, somehow, someone, somewhere, was, out, having, a, good, time, laughter, the, opponents, of, this, measure, and, those, who, have, authored, various, so-called, soak-the-rich, bills, that, are, floating, around, this, chamber, should, be, reminded, of, something, when, they, aim, at, big, guy, they, usually, h, little, guy, and, maybe, it's, time, that, stopped, this, then, is, my, short-term, plan, your, part, members, of, congress, requires, enactment, of, these, commonsense, proposals, that, will, have, a, strong, effect, on, economy, without, breaking, budget, agreement, and, without, raising, tax, rates, while, my, plan, is, being, passed, and, kicking, in, we've, got, to, care, for, those, in, trouble, today, have, provided, for, up, to, $4, 4, billion, in, my, budget, to, extend, federal, unemployment, benefits, and, ask, for, congressional, action, right, away, and, thank, committee, applause, well, at, last, let's, be, frank, let's, be, frank, let, me, level, with, you, know, and, you, know, that, my, plan, is, unveiled, in, a, political, season, laughter, know, and, you, know, that, everything, propose, will, be, viewed, by, some, in, merely, partisan, terms, but, ask, you, to, know, what, is, in, my, heart, and, my, aim, is, to, increase, our, nation's, good, i'm, doing, what, think, is, right, and, am, proposing, what, know, will, help, pride, myself, that, i'm, a, prudent, man, and, believe, that, patience, is, a, virtue, but, understand, that, politics, is, for, some, a, game, and, that, sometimes, game, is, to, stop, all, progress, and, then, decry, lack, of, improvement, laughter, but, let, me, tell, you, far, more, important, than, my, political, future, and, far, more, important, than, yours, is, well-being, of, our, country, members, of, this, chamber, are, practical, people, and, know, you, won't, resent, some, practical, advice, when, people, put, their, party's, fortunes, whatever, party, whatever, side, of, this, aisle, before, public, good, they, court, defeat, not, only, for, their, country, but, for, themselves, and, they, will, certainly, deserve, submmy, plan, tomorrow, and, i'm, asking, you, to, pass, by, march, 20, and, ask, american, people, to, let, you, know, they, want, this, action, by, march, 20, from, day, after, that, if, must, be, battle, is, joined, and, you, know, when, principle, is, at, stake, relish, a, good, fair, fight, said, my, plan, has, two, parts, and, does, and, it's, second, part, that, is, heart, of, matter, for, it's, not, enough, to, get, an, immediate, burst, we, need, long-term, improvement, in, our, economic, position, we, all, know, that, key, to, our, economic, future, is, to, ensure, that, america, continues, as, an, economic, leader, of, world, we, have, that, in, our, power, here, then, is, my, long-term, plan, to, guarantee, our, future, first, trade, we, will, work, to, break, down, walls, that, stop, world, trade, we, will, work, to, open, markets, everywhere, and, in, our, major, trade, negotiations, will, continue, pushing, to, eliminate, tariffs, and, subsidies, that, damage, america's, farmers, and, workers, and, we'll, get, more, good, american, jobs, within, our, own, hemisphere, through, north, american, free, trade, agreement, and, through, enterprise, for, americas, initiative, but, changes, are, here, and, more, are, coming, the, workplace, of, future, will, demand, more, highly, skilled, workers, than, ever, more, people, who, are, computer-literate, highly, educated, we, must, be, world's, leader, in, education, and, we, must, revolutionize, america's, schools, my, america, 2000, strategy, will, help, us, reach, that, goal, my, plan, will, give, parents, more, choice, give, teachers, more, flexibility, and, help, communities, create, new, american, schools, thirty, states, across, nation, have, established, america, 2000, programs, hundreds, of, cities, and, towns, have, joined, in, now, congress, must, join, this, great, movement, pass, my, proposals, for, new, american, schools, that, was, my, second, long-term, proposal, and, here's, my, third, we, must, make, commonsense, investments, that, will, help, us, compete, long-term, in, marketplace, we, must, encourage, research, and, development, my, plan, is, to, make, r, and, d, tax, credpermanent, and, to, provide, record, levels, of, support, over, $76, billion, this, year, alone, for, people, who, will, explore, promise, of, emerging, technologies, fourth, we, must, do, something, about, crime, and, drugs, it, is, time, for, a, major, renewed, investment, in, fighting, violent, street, crime, it, saps, our, strength, and, hurts, our, faith, in, our, society, and, in, our, future, together, surely, a, tired, woman, on, her, way, to, work, at, 6, in, morning, on, a, subway, deserves, right, to, get, there, safely, and, surely, it's, true, that, everyone, who, changes, his, or, her, life, because, of, crime, from, those, afraid, to, go, out, at, night, to, those, afraid, to, walk, in, parks, they, pay, for, surely, these, people, have, been, denied, a, basic, civil, right, it, is, time, to, restore, congress, pass, my, comprehensive, crime, bill, it, is, tough, on, criminals, and, supportive, of, police, and, has, been, languishing, in, these, hallowed, halls, for, years, now, pass, help, your, country, fifth, ask, you, tonight, to, fund, our, hope, housing, proposal, and, to, pass, my, enterprise, zone, legislation, which, will, get, businesses, into, inner, city, we, must, empower, poor, with, pride, that, comes, from, owning, a, home, getting, a, job, becoming, a, part, of, things, my, plan, would, encourage, real, estate, construction, by, extending, tax, incentives, for, mortgage, revenue, bonds, and, low-income, housing, and, ask, tonight, for, record, expenditures, for, program, that, helps, children, born, into, want, move, into, excellence, head, start, step, six, we, must, reform, our, health, care, system, for, this, too, bears, on, whether, or, not, we, can, compete, in, world, american, health, costs, have, been, exploding, this, year, america, will, spend, over, $800, billion, on, health, and, that, is, expected, to, grow, to, $1, 6, trillion, by, end, of, decade, we, simply, cannot, afford, this, the, cost, of, health, care, shows, up, not, only, in, your, family, budget, but, in, price, of, everything, we, buy, and, everything, we, sell, when, health, coverage, for, a, fellow, on, an, assembly, line, costs, thousands, of, dollars, cost, goes, into, products, he, makes, and, you, pay, bill, we, must, make, a, choice, now, some, pretend, we, can, have, both, ways, they, call, \"\"play, or, pay, \"\", but, that, expensive, approach, is, unstable, it, will, mean, higher, taxes, fewer, jobs, and, eventually, a, system, under, complete, government, control, really, there, are, only, two, options, and, we, can, move, toward, a, nationalized, system, a, system, which, will, restrict, patient, choice, in, picking, a, doctor, and, force, government, to, ration, services, arbitrarily, and, what, we'll, get, is, patients, in, long, lines, indifferent, service, and, a, huge, new, tax, burden, or, we, can, reform, our, own, private, health, care, system, which, still, gives, us, for, all, its, flaws, best, quality, health, care, in, world, well, let's, build, on, our, strengths, my, plan, provides, insurance, security, for, all, americans, while, preserving, and, increasing, idea, of, choice, we, make, basic, health, insurance, affordable, for, all, low-income, people, not, now, covered, and, we, do, by, providing, a, health, insurance, tax, credof, up, to, $3, 750, for, each, low-income, family, and, middle, class, gets, help, too, and, by, reforming, health, insurance, market, my, plan, assures, that, americans, will, have, access, to, basic, health, insurance, even, if, they, change, jobs, or, develop, serious, health, problems, we, must, bring, costs, under, control, preserve, quality, preserve, choice, and, reduce, people's, nagging, daily, worry, about, health, insurance, my, plan, details, of, which, i'll, announce, very, shortly, does, just, that, seventh, we, must, get, federal, deficunder, control, we, now, have, in, law, enforceable, spending, caps, and, a, requirement, that, we, pay, for, programs, we, create, there, are, those, in, congress, who, would, ease, that, discipline, now, but, cannot, let, them, do, and, won't, my, plan, would, freeze, all, domestic, discretionary, budget, authority, which, means, no, more, next, year, than, this, year, will, not, tamper, with, social, security, but, would, put, real, caps, on, growth, of, uncontrolled, spending, and, would, also, freeze, federal, domestic, government, employment, and, with, help, of, congress, my, plan, will, get, rid, of, 246, programs, that, don't, deserve, federal, funding, some, of, them, have, noble, titles, but, none, of, them, is, indispensable, we, can, get, rid, of, each, and, every, one, of, them, you, know, it's, time, we, rediscovered, a, home, truth, american, people, have, never, forgotten, this, government, is, too, big, and, spends, too, much, and, call, upon, congress, to, adopt, a, measure, that, will, help, put, an, end, to, annual, ritual, of, filling, budget, with, pork, barrel, appropriations, every, year, press, has, a, field, day, making, fun, of, outrageous, examples, a, lawrence, welk, museum, research, grants, for, belgian, endive, we, all, know, how, these, things, get, into, budget, and, maybe, you, need, someone, to, help, you, say, no, know, how, to, say, and, know, what, need, to, make, stick, give, me, same, thing, 43, governors, have, line-item, veto, and, let, me, help, you, control, spending, we, must, put, an, end, to, unfinanced, federal, government, mandates, these, are, requirements, congress, puts, on, our, cities, counties, and, states, without, supplying, money, if, congress, passes, a, mandate, should, be, forced, to, pay, for, and, balance, cost, with, savings, elsewhere, after, all, a, mandate, just, increases, someone, else's, burden, and, that, means, higher, taxes, at, state, and, local, level, step, eight, congress, should, enact, bold, reform, proposals, that, are, still, awaiting, congressional, action, bank, reform, civil, justice, reform, tort, reform, and, my, national, energy, strategy, and, finally, we, must, strengthen, family, because, is, family, that, has, greatest, bearing, on, our, future, when, barbara, holds, an, aids, baby, in, her, arms, and, reads, to, children, she's, saying, to, every, person, in, this, country, family, matters, and, am, announcing, tonight, a, new, commission, on, america's, urban, families, i've, asked, missouri's, governor, john, ashcroft, to, be, chairman, former, dallas, mayor, annette, strauss, to, be, cochair, you, know, had, mayors, leading, mayors, from, league, of, cities, in, other, day, at, white, house, and, they, told, me, something, striking, they, said, that, every, one, of, them, republican, or, democrat, agreed, on, one, thing, that, major, cause, of, problems, of, cities, is, dissolution, of, family, they, asked, for, this, commission, and, they, were, right, to, ask, because, it's, time, to, determine, what, we, can, do, to, keep, families, together, strong, and, sound, there's, one, thing, we, can, do, right, away, ease, burden, of, rearing, a, child, ask, you, tonight, to, raise, personal, exemption, by, $500, per, child, for, every, family, for, a, family, with, four, kids, that's, an, increase, of, $2, 000, this, is, a, good, start, in, right, direction, and, it's, what, we, can, afford, it's, time, to, allow, families, to, deduct, interest, they, pay, on, student, loans, am, asking, you, to, do, just, that, and, i'm, asking, you, to, allow, people, to, use, money, from, their, iras, to, pay, medical, and, education, expenses, all, without, penalties, and, i'm, asking, for, more, ask, american, parents, what, they, dislike, about, how, things, are, going, in, our, country, and, chances, are, good, that, pretty, soon, they'll, get, to, welfare, americans, are, most, generous, people, on, earth, but, we, have, to, go, back, to, insight, of, franklin, roosevelt, who, when, he, spoke, of, what, became, welfare, program, warned, that, must, not, become, \"\"a, narcotic\"\", and, a, \"\"subtle, destroyer\"\", of, spir, welfare, was, never, meant, to, be, a, lifestyle, it, was, never, meant, to, be, a, hab, it, was, never, supposed, to, be, passed, from, generation, to, generation, like, a, legacy, it's, time, to, replace, assumptions, of, welfare, state, and, help, reform, welfare, system, states, throughout, country, are, beginning, to, operate, with, new, assumptions, that, when, able-bodied, people, receive, government, assistance, they, have, responsibilities, to, taxpayer, a, responsibility, to, seek, work, education, or, job, training;, a, responsibility, to, get, their, lives, in, order;, a, responsibility, to, hold, their, families, together, and, refrain, from, having, children, out, of, wedlock;, and, a, responsibility, to, obey, law, we, are, going, to, help, this, movement, often, state, reform, requires, waiving, certain, federal, regulations, will, act, to, make, that, process, easier, and, quicker, for, every, state, that, asks, for, our, help, want, to, add, as, we, make, these, changes, we, work, together, to, improve, this, system, that, our, intention, is, not, scapegoating, or, finger-pointing, if, you, read, papers, and, watch, tv, you, know, there's, been, a, rise, these, days, in, a, certain, kind, of, ugliness, racist, comments, anti-semitism, an, increased, sense, of, division, really, this, is, not, us, this, is, not, who, we, are, and, this, is, not, acceptable, and, so, you, have, my, plan, for, america, and, i'm, asking, for, big, things, but, believe, in, my, heart, you'll, do, what's, right, you, know, it's, kind, of, an, american, tradition, to, show, a, certain, skepticism, toward, our, democratic, institutions, myself, have, sometimes, thought, aging, process, could, be, delayed, if, had, to, make, its, way, through, congress, laughter, you, will, deliberate, and, you, will, discuss, and, that, is, fine, but, my, friends, people, cannot, wa, they, need, help, now, there's, a, mood, among, us, people, are, worried, there's, been,

      "|bush      |Republican      |Speech1 |\"Jim Lehrer and welcome to first of three debates among major candidates for of United States sponsored by Commission on Presidential Debates The candidates are independent candidate Ross Perot; Governor Bill Clinton Democratic nominee; and George Bush Republican nominee am Jim Lehrer of \"\"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour\"\" on PBS and will be moderator for this 90-minute event which is taking place before an audience here in Athletic Complex on campus of Washington University in St Louis Missouri Three journalists will be asking questions tonight They are John Mashek of Boston Globe; Ann Compton of ABC News; and Sander Vanocur a freelance journalist We will follow a format agreed to by representatives of Clinton and Bush campaigns That agreement contains no restrictions on content or subject matter of questions Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes for a closing statement The order of those as well as questioning was determined by a drawing The first question goes to Perot He will have 2 minutes to answer to be followed by rebuttals of one minute each from Governor Clinton and then Bush Distinction Among CandidatesGentlemen good evening The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from other Perot what do you believe tonight is single most important separating issue of this campaign? Perot think principal issue that separates me is that 5 1/2 million people came together on their own and put me on ballot was not put on ballot by either of two parties was not put on ballot by any PAC money by any foreign lobbyist money by any special interest money This is a movement that came from people This is way framers of Constitution intended our Government to be a Government that comes from people Over time we have developed a Government that comes at people that comes from top down where people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature The thing that separates my candidacy and makes unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 States all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them go into this race as their servant and belong to them So this comes from people Lehrer Governor Clinton one-minute response Governor Clinton The most important distinction in this campaign is that represent real hope for change a departure from trickle-down economics a departure from tax-and-spend economics to invest and grow But before can do that must challenge American people to change and they must decide Tonight say to Bush for 12 years you've had your way You've had your chance and didn't work It's time to change want to bring that change to American people but we must all decide first we have courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow Lehrer Bush one-minute response sir Bush Well think one thing that distinguishes is experience think we've dramatically changed world I'll talk about that a little blater but changes are mind-boggling for world peace Kids go to bed at night without same fear of nuclear war And change for change's sake isn't enough We saw that message in late seventies when we heard a lot about change And what happened? That \"\"misery index\"\" went right through roof But my economic program think is kind of change we want And way we're going to get done is we're going to have a brandnew Congress A lot of them are thrown out because of all scandals I'll sdown with them Democrats and Republicans alike and work for my Agenda for American Renewal which represents real change But I'd say if you had to separate out think it's experience at this level Lehrer Governor Clinton how do you respond to -- you have 2 minutes -- on question of experience? He says that is what distinguishes him from other two of you Governor Clinton believe experience counts but it's not everything Values judgment and record that have amassed in my State also should count for something I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people My State now ranks first in country in job growth this year fourth in income growth fourth in reduction of poverty third in overall economic performance according to a major news magazine That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs We have to change in this country You know my wife Hillary gave me a book about a year ago in which author defined insanity as just doing same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result We have got to have courage to change Experience is important yes I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over last year and a month I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope more pain and more promise than anybody else who's run for this year And think American people deserve better than they're getting We have gone from first to 13th in world in wages in last 12 years since Bush and Reagan have been in Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder in last 4 years There have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created We need a new approach The same old experience is not relevant We're living in a new world after cold war And what works in this new world is not trickle-down not Government for benefof privileged few not tax-and-spend but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education Controlling American health care costs and bringing American people together that is what works And you can have right kind of experience and wrong kind of experience Mine is rooted in real lives of real people And will bring real results if we have courage to change Lehrer Bush one minute to respond Bush just thought of another another big difference here between me -- don't believe Perot feels this way but know Governor Clinton did because want to accurately quote him He thinks think he said that country is coming apart at seams Now know that only way he can win is to make everybody believe economy is worse than is But this country's not coming apart at seams for heaven sakes We're United States of America In spite of economic problems we are most respected economy around world Many would trade for We've been caught up in a global slowdown We can do much much better But we ought not to try to convince American people that America is a country that's coming apart at seams would hate to be running for and think that only way could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are Yes there are big problems And yes people are hurting But believe that this Agenda for American Renewal have is answer to do And believe we can get done now whereas we didn't in past because you're going to have a whole brandnew bunch of people in Congress that are going to have to listen to same American people I'm listening to Lehrer Perot a minute response sir Perot Well they've got a point don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt don't have any experience in gridlocked Government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else don't have any experience in creating worst public school system in industrialized world most violent crime-ridden society in industrialized world But do have a lot of experience in getting things done So if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about and do I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems making solutions work and then moving on to next one I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem So if it's time for action think have experience that counts If it's more time for gridlock and talk and finger-pointing I'm wrong man Lehrer Bush question goes to you You have 2 minutes And question is this Are there important issues of character separating you from these other two men? Bush think American people should be judge of that think character is a very important question said something other day where was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because questioned -- put this way -- think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil just think it's wrong Maybe they say well was a youthful indiscretion was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander in Chief of Armed Forces And I'm sorry but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism It's a question of character and judgment They get on me Bill's gotten on me about \"\"Read my lips \"\" When make a mistake I'll adm But he has not admitted mistake And just find impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land organizing demonstrations against when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of ghetto were drafted Some say well you're a little old-fashioned Maybe am but just don't think that's right Now whether it's character or judgment whatever is have a big difference here on this issue And so we'll just have to see how plays out But couldn't do that And don't think most Americans could do that And they all say well was a long time ago Well let's admthen say \"\" made a terrible mistake \"\" How could you be Commander in Chief of Armed Forces and have some kid say when you have to make a tough decision as did in Panama or in Kuwa and then have some kid jump up and say \"\"Well I'm not going to go The Commander in Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around world during another era\"\"?So there are differences But that's about main area where think we have a difference don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a b Lehrer Perot you have one minute Perot think American people will make their own decisions on character And at a time when we have work to do and we need action think they need to clearly understand backgrounds of each person think press can play a huge role in making sure that backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way Then make a decision Certainly anyone in White House should have character to be there But think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred Did they occur when you were a young person in your formative years or did they occur while you were a senior official in Federal Government? When you're a senior official in Federal Government spending billions of dollars in taxpayers' money and you're a mature individual and you make a mistake then that was on our ticket If you make as a young man time passes So would say just look at all three of us decide who you think will do job pick that person in November because believe me as I've said before party's over and it's time for cleanup crew And we do have to have change And people who never take responsibility for anything when happens on their watch and people who are in charge -- -- Lehrer Your time is up Perot -- -- time is up Lehrer Time is up Perot More later Lehrer Governor Clinton you have one minute Governor Clinton Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Bush You have questioned my patriotism You even brought some right-wing Congressmen into White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969 - 1970 when over 50 000 other Americans did Now honor your service in World War I honor Perot's service in uniform and service of every man and woman who ever served including Admiral Crowe who was your Chairman of Joint Chiefs and who's supporting me But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong He was wrong And a Senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy You were wrong to attack my patriotism was opposed to war but love my country And we need a who will bring this country together not divide We've had enough division want to lead a unified country Lehrer All right We move now to subject of taxes and spending The question goes to Governor Clinton for a two-minute answer It will be asked by Ann Compton TaxesAnn Compton Governor Clinton can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle-income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or at very least at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase? Governor Clinton The tax increase have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200 000 and above Those are people who in 1980's had their incomes go up while their taxes went down Middle-class people defined as people with incomes of $52 000 and down had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in Reagan-Bush years because of six increases in payroll taxes So that is where my income limwould trigger Ms Compton So there will be no tax increases below $200 000? Governor Clinton My plan notwithstanding my opponent's ad my plan triggers in at gross incomes family incomes of $200 000 and above And then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness especially to middle-class people with families with incomes of under $60 000 In addition to that money that raise from upper income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper income people want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credlike Kennedy and Congress inaugurated in early sixties to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions We've got to have no more trickle-down We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for wealthy for nothing; we need to say here's your tax incentive if you create American jobs old-fashioned way I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Bush and Reagan but don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in private sector And that's what's happened in last 4 years We're down 35 000 jobs in private sector We need to invest and grow and that's what want to do Lehrer Bush one minute sir Bush have to correct one thing didn't question man's patriotism; questioned his judgment and his character What he did in Moscow that's fine Let him explain He did accept that What don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war I'm sorry cannot accept that This one on taxes spells out biggest difference between us do not believe we need to go back to Mondale proposals or Dukakis proposals of tax-and-spend Governor Clinton says $200 000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion Taxing people over $200 000 will not get you $150 billion And then when you add in his other spending proposals regrettably you end up socking to working man That old adage that they use \"\"We're going to soak rich we're going to soak rich \"\" always ends up being poor cab driver or working man that ends up paying bill And so just have a different approach believe way to get deficdown is to control growth of mandatory spending programs and not raise taxes on American people We've got a big difference there Lehrer Perot one minute Perot We've got to have a growing expanding job base to give us a growing expanding tax base Right now we have a flat-to-deteriorating job base and where appears to be growing is minimum-wage jobs So we've got to really rebuild our job base That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that Our foreign competitors are doing it; we're not We cannot pay off $4 trillion debt balance budget and have industries of future and high-paying jobs in this country without having revenue We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice There's one challenge It's got to be fair We've created a mess and don't have much to show for and we have got to fix And that's about all can say in a minute Lehrer Okay Next question goes to Bush for a 2-minute answer and will be asked by Sandy Vanocur U S Troops in EuropeSander Vanocur this past week your Secretary of Army Michael Stone said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut U S forces in Europe from 150 000 to 100 000 by end of September 1996 Now why almost 50 years after end of World War I and with total collapse of Soviet Union should American taxpayers be taxed support armies in Europe when Europeans have plenty of money to do for themselves? Bush Well Sander that's a good question And answer is For 40-some years we kept peace If you look at cost of not keeping peace in Europe would be exorbitant We have reduced number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed have cut defense spending And reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning cold war We never would have got there if we'd gone for nuclear-freeze crowd; never would have got there if we'd listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending think is important that United States stay in Europe and continue to guarantee peace We simply cannot pull back Now when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home they say well let's cut money out of Defense Department will accept and have accepted recommendations of two proven leaders General Colin Powell and Dick Secretary Dick Cheney They feel that levels we're operating at and reductions that have proposed are proper And so simply do not think we should go back to isolation days and start blaming foreigners We are sole remaining superpower And we should be that We have a certain disproportionate responsibility But would ask American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts if we go too far we risk peace And don't want to do that I've seen what is like to see burdens of a war and don't want to see us make reckless cuts Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending But let's not cut into muscle And let's not cut down our insurance policy which is participation of American forces in NATO greatest peacekeeping organization ever made Today you've got problems in Europe still bubbling along even though Europe's going democracy's route But we are there And think this insurance policy is necessary think goes with world leadership And think levels we've come up with are just about right Lehrer Perot one minute sir Perot If I'm poor and you're rich and can get you to defend me that's good But when tables get turned ought to do my share Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense The Japanese spend around $30 billion in Asia The Germans spend around $30 billion in Europe For example Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over next 10 years It's kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30 billion tab to defend your country The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in past agree with when they couldn't we should have; now that they can they should We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control They don't want us to control very candidly So think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure Because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing expanding job base Lehrer Governor Clinton one minute sir Governor Clinton agree with general statement Bush made disagree that we need 150 000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe We certainly must maintain an engagement there There are certainly dangers there There are certainly other trouble spots in world which are closer to Europe than to United States But two former Defense Secretaries recently issued reports saying that 100 000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough including Reagan's former Defense Secretary Carlucci Many of military experts whom consulted on this agreed We're going to have to spend more money in future on military technology and on greater mobility greater airlift greater sealift B-22 airplane We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly and simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150 000 troops in Europe given how much Red Army now under control of Russia has been cut; arms control agreement concluded between Bush and Yeltsin something have applauded don't think we need 150 000 troops Let me make one other point Bush talked about taxes He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle-class tax cut because would be paid for by raising taxes on wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credpaid for by raising taxes on wealthy Taxes Lehrer All right We go now to Perot for a 2-minute question and will be asked by John Mashek John Mashek Perot you talked about fairness just a minute ago on sharing pain As part of your plan to reduce ballooning Federal defic you've suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years Why punish middle-class consumer to such a degree? Perot It's 10 cents a year cumulative It finally gets to 50 cents at end of fifth year think \"\"punish\"\" is wrong word Again you see didn't create this problem; we're trying to solve Now if you study our international competitors some of our international competitors collect up to $3 50 a gallon in taxes And they use that money to build infrastructure and create jobs We collect 35 cents and we don't have to spend know it's not popular And understand nature of your question But people who will be helped most by are working people who will get jobs created because of this tax Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over years and is now time to pay fiddler And if we don't we will be spending our children's money We have spent $4 trillion worth An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they're deeply concerned that we have taken American dream from them think it's fitting that we're on campus of a university tonight These young people when they get out of this wonderful university will have difficulty finding a job We've got to clean this mess up leave this country in good shape and pass on American dream to them We're got to collect taxes to do If there's a fairer way I'm all ears Ah-h-h But see let me make very clear People don't have stomach to fix these problems think it's a good time to face in November If they do then they will have heard harsh reality of what we have to do I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight Lehrer Governor Clinton you have a minute sir Governor Clinton think Perot has confronted this deficissue but think it's important to point out that we really have two deficits in America not one We have a budget deficin federal government but we also have an investment a jobs an income defic People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago two-thirds of our people a $1 600 drop in average income in just last 2 years The problem have with Perot prescription is that almost all economists who have looked at say that if you cut deficthis much this quick will increase unemployment will slow down economy That's why think we shouldn't do that quickly We have a disciplined reduction in deficof 50 percent over next 4 years But first get incentives to invest in this economy put American people back to work We've got to invest in growth Nine Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives have endorsed this approach because offers best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling Lehrer Bush one minute sir Bush The question was on fairness just disagree with Perot don't believe is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on people that have to drive for a living people that go long distances don't think we need to do You see have a fundamental difference agree with what he's talking about in trying to get spending down and to discipline although think we ought to totally exempt Social Security But he's talking tough medicine and think that's good disagree with tax-and-spend philosophy You see don't think we need to tax more and spend more and then say that's going to make problem better And I'm afraid that's what think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about control growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down He's mentioned some ways to do and agree with those I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever And his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for rich It would stimulate investment I'm for an investment tax allowance am for a tax break for first-time homebuyers And with this new Congress coming in gridlock will be gone and I'll sdown with them and say let's get this done But do not want to go tax-and-spend route Lehrer All right Let's move on now to subject of jobs The first question goes to Bush for 2 minutes and John will ask that question John?The Defense Industry Mashek last month you came to St Louis to announce a very lucrative contract for McDonnell Douglas to build F-15's for Saudi Arabia In today's Post-Dispatch a retired saleswoman a 75-year-old woman named Marjorie Roberts asked if she could ask a question of candidates said she wanted to register her concern about lack of a plan to convert our defense-oriented industries into other purposes How would you answer her? Bush Well assume she was supportive of decision on McDonnell Douglas assume she was supporting me on decision to sell those airplanes think it's a good decision took a little heat for but think was correct decision to do And we've worked out and indeed we're moving forward all around world in a much more peaceful way So that one we came away with which -- in creating jobs for American people would simply say to her look take a look at what has proposed on job retraining When you cut back on defense spending some people are going to be thrown out of work If you throw another 50 000 kids on street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels you're going to put a lot more out of work would say to them look at job retraining programs that we're proposing Therein is best answer to her And another one is stimulate investment and savings mean we've got big economic problems but we are not coming apart at seams We're ready for a recovery with interest rates down and inflation down cruelest tax of all; caught up in a global slowdown right now but that will change if you go with programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is answer A little longer run; it's going to take a while to educate but is a good program So her best hope for short term is job retraining if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant But tell her it's not all that gloomy We're United States We've faced tough problems before Look at \"\"misery index\"\" when Democrats had both White House and Congress It was just right through roof Now we can do better And way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain get that control of mandatory spending programs am much more optimistic about this country than some Lehrer Perot you have one minute sir Perot Your defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries many of them are And sooner they start sooner they'll finish And there will be a significant transition And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate We had someone who I'm sure regrets said in President's staff said he didn't care whether we make potato chips or computer chips Well anybody that thinks about cares a great deal Number one you make more making computer chips than you do potato chips Number two 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan We've given away whole industries So as we phase these industries over there's a lot of intellectual talent in these industries A lot of these people in industries can be converted to industries of tomorrow And that's where high-paying jobs are We need to have a very carefully thought through phaseover See we practice 19th-century capitalism The rest of world practices 21st-century capitalism can't handle that in a minute but hope we can get back into later The rest of world countries and businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way Lehrer Governor Clinton you have one minute sir Governor Clinton We must have a transition plan a plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that There are 200 000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in technologies of future here at home That is what want to do This administration may say they have a plan but truth is they have not even released all money paltry sum of money that Congress appropriated w\"|29018 |[\"jim, lehrer, and, welcome, to, first, of, three, debates, among, major, candidates, for, of, united, states, sponsored, by, commission, on, presidential, debates,

questions, each, candidate, will, have, up, to, 2, minutes, for, a, closing, statement, the, order, of, those, as, well, as, questioning, was, determined, by, a, drawing, the, first, question, goes, to, perot, he, will, have, 2, minutes, to, answer, to, be, followed, by, rebuttals, of, one, minute, each, from, governor, clinton, and, then, bush, distinction, among, candidatesgentlemen, good, evening, the, first, topic, tonight, is, what, separates, each, of, you, from, other, perot, what, do, you, believe, tonight, is, single, most, important, separating, issue, of, this, campaign?, perot, think, principal, issue, that, separates, me, is, that, 5, 1/2, million, people, came, together, on, their, own, and, put, me, on, ballot, was, not, put, on, ballot, by, either, of, two, parties, was, not, put, on, ballot, by, any, pac, money, by, any, foreign, lobbyist, money, by, any, special, interest, money, this, is, a, movement, that, came, from, people, this, is, way, framers, of, constitution, intended, our, government, to, be, a, government, that, comes, from, people, over, time, we, have, developed, a, government, that, comes, at, people, that, comes, from, top, down, where, people, are, more, or, less, treated, as, objects, to, be, programmed, during, campaign, with, commercials, and, media, events, and, fear, messages, and, personal, attacks, and, things, of, that, nature, the, thing, that, separates, my, candidacy, and, makes, unique, is, that, this, came, from, millions, of, people, in, 50, states, all, over, this, country, who, wanted, a, candidate, that, worked, and, belonged, to, nobody, but, them, go, into, this, race, as, their, servant, and, belong, to, them, so, this, comes, from, people, lehrer, governor, clinton, one-minute, response, governor, clinton, the, most, important, distinction, in, this, campaign, is, that, represent, real, hope, for, change, a, departure, from, trickle-down, economics, a, departure, from, tax-and-spend, economics, to, invest, and, grow, but, before, can, do, that, must, challenge, american, people, to, change, and, they, must, decide, tonight, say, to, bush, for, 12, years, you've, had, your, way, you've, had, your, chance, and, didn't, work, it's, time, to, change, want, to, bring, that, change, to, american, people, but, we, must, all, decide, first, we, have, courage, to, change, for, hope, and, a, better, tomorrow, lehrer, bush, one-minute, response, sir, bush, well, think, one, thing, that, distinguishes, is, experience, think, we've, dramatically, changed, world, i'll, talk, about, that, a, little, blater, but, changes, are, mind-boggling, for, world, peace, kids, go, to, bed, at, night, without, same, fear, of, nuclear, war, and, change, for, change's, sake, isn't, enough, we, saw, that, message, in, late, seventies, when, we, heard, a, lot, about, change, and, what, happened?, that, \"\"misery, index\"\", went, right, through, roof, but, my, economic, program, think, is, kind, of, change, we, want, and, way, we're, going, to, get, done, is, we're, going, to, have, a, brandnew, congress, a, lot, of, them, are, thrown, out, because, of, all, scandals, i'll, sdown, with, them, democrats, and, republicans, alike, and, work, for, my, agenda, for, american, renewal, which, represents, real, change, but, i'd, say, if, you, had, to, separate, out, think, it's, experience, at, this, level, lehrer, governor, clinton, how, do, you, respond, to, --, you, have, 2, minutes, --, on, question, of, experience?, he, says, that, is, what, distinguishes, him, from, other, two, of, you, governor, clinton, believe, experience, counts, but, it's, not, everything, values, judgment, and, record, that, have, amassed, in, my, state, also, should, count, for, something, i've, worked, hard, to, create, good, jobs, and, to, educate, people, my, state, now, ranks, first, in, country, in, job, growth, this, year, fourth, in, income, growth, fourth, in, reduction, of, poverty, third, in, overall, economic, performance, according, to, a, major, news, magazine, that's, because, we, believe, in, investing, in, education, and, in, jobs, we, have, to, change, in, this, country, you, know, my, wife, hillary, gave, me, a, book, about, a, year, ago, in, which, author, defined, insanity, as, just, doing, same, old, thing, over, and, over, again, and, expecting, a, different, result, we, have, got, to, have, courage, to, change, experience, is, important, yes, i've, gotten, a, lot, of, good, experience, in, dealing, with, ordinary, people, over, last, year, and, a, month, i've, touched, more, people's, lives, and, seen, more, heartbreak, and, hope, more, pain, and, more, promise, than, anybody, else, who's, run, for, this, year, and, think, american, people, deserve, better, than, they're, getting, we, have, gone, from, first, to, 13th, in, world, in, wages, in, last, 12, years, since, bush, and, reagan, have, been, in, personal, income, has, dropped, while, people, have, worked, harder, in, last, 4, years, there, have, been, twice, as, many, bankruptcies, as, new, jobs, created, we, need, a, new, approach, the, same, old, experience, is, not, relevant, we're, living, in, a, new, world, after, cold, war, and, what, works, in, this, new, world, is, not, trickle-down, not, government, for, benefof, privileged, few, not, tax-and-spend, but, a, commitment, to, invest, in, american, jobs, and, american, education, controlling, american, health, care, costs, and, bringing, american, people, together, that, is, what, works, and, you, can, have, right, kind, of, experience, and, wrong, kind, of, experience, mine, is, rooted, in, real, lives, of, real, people, and, will, bring, real, results, if, we, have, courage, to, change, lehrer, bush, one, minute, to, respond, bush, just, thought, of, another, another, big, difference, here, between, me, --, don't, believe, perot, feels, this, way, but, know, governor, clinton, did, because, want, to, accurately, quote, him, he, thinks, think, he, said, that, country, is, coming, apart, at, seams, now, know, that, only, way, he, can, win, is, to, make, everybody, believe, economy, is, worse, than, is, but, this, country's, not, coming, apart, at, seams, for, heaven, sakes, we're, united, states, of, america, in, spite, of, economic, problems, we, are, most, respected, economy, around, world, many, would, trade, for, we've, been, caught, up, in, a, global, slowdown, we, can, do, much, much, better, but, we, ought, not, to, try, to, convince, american, people, that, america, is, a, country, that's, coming, apart, at, seams, would, hate, to, be, running, for, and, think, that, only, way, could, win, would, be, to, convince, everybody, how, horrible, things, are, yes, there, are, big, problems, and, yes, people, are, hurting, but, believe, that, this, agenda, for, american, renewal, have, is, answer, to, do, and, believe, we, can, get, done, now, whereas, we, didn't, in, past, because, you're, going, to, have, a, whole, brandnew, bunch, of, people, in, congress, that, are, going, to, have, to, listen, to, same, american, people, i'm, listening, to, lehrer, perot, a, minute, response, sir, perot, well, they've, got, a, point, don't, have, any, experience, in, running, up, a, $4, trillion, debt, don't, have, any, experience, in, gridlocked, government, where, nobody, takes, responsibility, for, anything, and, everybody, blames, everybody, else, don't, have, any, experience, in, creating, worst, public, school, system, in, industrialized, world, most, violent, crime-ridden, society, in, industrialized, world, but, do, have, a, lot, of, experience, in, getting, things, done, so, if, we're, at, a, point, in, history, where, we, want, to, stop, talking, about, and, do, i've, got, a, lot, of, experience, in, figuring, out, how, to, solve, problems, making, solutions, work, and, then, moving, on, to, next, one, i've, got, a, lot, of, experience, in, not, taking, 10, years, to, solve, a, 10-minute, problem, so, if, it's, time, for, action, think, have, experience, that, counts, if, it's, more, time, for, gridlock, and, talk, and, finger-pointing, i'm, wrong, man, lehrer, bush, question, goes, to, you, you, have, 2, minutes, and, question, is, this, are, there, important, issues, of, character, separating, you, from, these, other, two, men?, bush, think, american, people, should, be, judge, of, that, think, character, is, a, very, important, question, said, something, other, day, where, was, accused, of, being, like, joe, mccarthy, because, questioned, --, put, this, way, --, think, it's, wrong, to, demonstrate, against, your, own, country, or, organize, demonstrations, against, your, own, country, in, foreign, soil, just, think, it's, wrong, maybe, they, say, well, was, a, youthful, indiscretion, was, 19, or, 20, flying, off, an, aircraft, carrier, and, that, shaped, me, to, be, commander, in, chief, of, armed, forces, and, i'm, sorry, but, demonstrating, --, it's, not, a, question, of, patriotism, it's, a, question, of, character, and, judgment, they, get, on, me, bill's, gotten, on, me, about, \"\"read, my, lips, \"\", when, make, a, mistake, i'll, adm, but, he, has, not, admitted, mistake, and, just, find, impossible, to, understand, how, an, american, can, demonstrate, against, his, own, country, in, a, foreign, land, organizing, demonstrations, against, when, young, men, are, held, prisoner, in, hanoi, or, kids, out, of, ghetto, were, drafted, some, say, well, you're, a, little, old-fashioned, maybe, am, but, just, don't, think, that's, right, now, whether, it's, character, or, judgment, whatever, is, have, a, big, difference, here, on, this, issue, and, so, we'll, just, have, to, see, how, plays, out, but, couldn't, do, that, and, don't, think, most, americans, could, do, that, and, they, all, say, well, was, a, long, time, ago, well, let's, admthen, say, \"\", made, a, terrible, mistake, \"\", how, could, you, be, commander, in, chief, of, armed, forces, and, have, some, kid, say, when, you, have, to, make, a, tough, decision, as, did, in, panama, or, in, kuwa, and, then, have, some, kid, jump, up, and, say, \"\"well, i'm, not, going, to, go, the, commander, in, chief, was, organizing, demonstrations, halfway, around, world, during, another, era\"\"?so, there, are, differences, but, that's, about, main, area, where, think, we, have, a, difference, don't, know, about, --, we'll, talk, about, that, a, little, with, ross, here, in, a, b, lehrer, perot, you, have, one, minute, perot, think, american, people, will, make, their, own, decisions, on, character, and, at, a, time, when, we, have, work, to, do, and, we, need, action, think, they, need, to, clearly, understand, backgrounds, of, each, person, think, press, can, play, a, huge, role, in, making, sure, that, backgrounds, are, clearly, presented, in, an, objective, way, then, make, a, decision, certainly, anyone, in, white, house, should, have, character, to, be, there, but, think, it's, very, important, to, measure, when, and, where, things, occurred, did, they, occur, when, you, were, a, young, person, in, your, formative, years, or, did, they, occur, while, you, were, a, senior, official, in, federal, government?, when, you're, a, senior, official, in, federal, government, spending, billions, of, dollars, in, taxpayers', money, and, you're, a, mature, individual, and, you, make, a, mistake, then, that, was, on, our, ticket, if, you, make, as, a, young, man, time, passes, so, would, say, just, look, at, all, three, of, us, decide, who, you, think, will, do, job, pick, that, person, in, november, because, believe, me, as, i've, said, before, party's, over, and, it's, time, for, cleanup, crew, and, we, do, have, to, have, change, and, people, who, never, take, responsibility, for, anything, when, happens, on, their, watch, and, people, who, are, in, charge, --, --, lehrer, your, time, is, up, perot, --, --, time, is, up, lehrer, time, is, up, perot, more, later, lehrer, governor, clinton, you, have, one, minute, governor, clinton, ross, gave, a, good, answer, but, i've, got, to, respond, directly, to, bush, you, have, questioned, my, patriotism, you, even, brought, some, right-wing, congressmen, into, white, house, to, plot, how, to, attack, me, for, going, to, russia, in, 1969, -, 1970, when, over, 50, 000, other, americans, did, now, honor, your, service, in, world, war, i, honor, perot's, service, in, uniform, and, service, of, every, man, and, woman, who, ever, served, including, admiral, crowe, who, was, your, chairman, of, joint, chiefs, and, who's, supporting, me, but, when, joe, mccarthy, went, around, this, country, attacking, people's, patriotism, he, was, wrong, he, was, wrong, and, a, senator, from, connecticut, stood, up, to, him, named, prescott, bush, your, father, was, right, to, stand, up, to, joe, mccarthy, you, were, wrong, to, attack, my, patriotism, was, opposed, to, war, but, love, my, country, and, we, need, a, who, will, bring, this, country, together, not, divide, we've, had, enough, division, want, to, lead, a, unified, country, lehrer, all, right, we, move, now, to, subject, of, taxes, and, spending, the, question, goes, to, governor, clinton, for, a, two-minute, answer, it, will, be, asked, by, ann, compton, taxesann, compton, governor, clinton, can, you, lock, in, a, level, here, tonight, on, where, middle-income, families, can, be, guaranteed, a, tax, cut, or, at, very, least, at, what, income, level, they, can, be, guaranteed, no, tax, increase?, governor, clinton, the, tax, increase, have, proposed, triggers, in, at, family, incomes, of, $200, 000, and, above, those, are, people, who, in, 1980's, had, their, incomes, go, up, while, their, taxes, went, down, middle-class, people, defined, as, people, with, incomes, of, $52, 000, and, down, had, their, incomes, go, down, while, their, taxes, went, up, in, reagan-bush, years, because, of, six, increases, in, payroll, taxes, so, that, is, where, my, income, limwould, trigger, ms, compton, so, there, will, be, no, tax, increases, below, $200, 000?, governor, clinton, my, plan, notwithstanding, my, opponent's, ad, my, plan, triggers, in, at, gross, incomes, family, incomes, of, $200, 000, and, above, and, then, we, want, to, give, modest, middle-class, tax, relief, to, restore, some, fairness, especially, to, middle-class, people, with, families, with, incomes, of, under, $60, 000, in, addition, to, that, money, that, raise, from, upper, income, people, and, from, asking, foreign, corporations, just, to, pay, same, income, on, their, income, earned, in, america, that, american, corporations, do, will, be, used, to, give, incentives, back, to, upper, income, people, want, to, give, people, permanent, incentives, on, investment, tax, credlike, kennedy, and, congress, inaugurated, in, early, sixties, to, get, industry, moving, again;, a, research, and, development, tax, credit;, a, low-income, housing, tax, credit;, a, long-term, capital, gains, proposal, for, new, business, and, business, expansions, we've, got, to, have, no, more, trickle-down, we, don't, need, across-the-board, tax, cuts, for, wealthy, for, nothing;, we, need, to, say, here's, your, tax, incentive, if, you, create, american, jobs, old-fashioned, way, i'd, like, to, create, more, millionaires, than, were, created, under, bush, and, reagan, but, don't, want, to, have, 4, years, where, we, have, no, growth, in, private, sector, and, that's, what's, happened, in, last, 4, years, we're, down, 35, 000, jobs, in, private, sector, we, need, to, invest, and, grow, and, that's, what, want, to, do, lehrer, bush, one, minute, sir, bush, have, to, correct, one, thing, didn't, question, man's, patriotism;, questioned, his, judgment, and, his, character, what, he, did, in, moscow, that's, fine, let, him, explain, he, did, accept, that, what, don't, accept, is, demonstrating, and, organizing, demonstrations, in, a, foreign, country, when, your, country's, at, war, i'm, sorry, cannot, accept, that, this, one, on, taxes, spells, out, biggest, difference, between, us, do, not, believe, we, need, to, go, back, to, mondale, proposals, or, dukakis, proposals, of, tax-and-spend, governor, clinton, says, $200, 000, but, he, also, says, he, wants, to, raise, $150, billion, taxing, people, over, $200, 000, will, not, get, you, $150, billion, and, then, when, you, add, in, his, other, spending, proposals, regrettably, you, end, up, socking, to, working, man, that, old, adage, that, they, use, \"\"we're, going, to, soak, rich, we're, going, to, soak, rich, \"\", always, ends, up, being, poor, cab, driver, or, working, man, that, ends, up, paying, bill, and, so, just, have, a, different, approach, believe, way, to, get, deficdown, is, to, control, growth, of, mandatory, spending, programs, and, not, raise, taxes, on, american, people, we've, got, a, big, difference, there, lehrer, perot, one, minute, perot, we've, got, to, have, a, growing, expanding, job, base, to, give, us, a, growing, expanding, tax, base, right, now, we, have, a, flat-to-deteriorating, job, base, and, where, appears, to, be, growing, is, minimum-wage, jobs, so, we've, got, to, really, rebuild, our, job, base, that's, going, to, take, money, for, infrastructure, and, investment, to, do, that, our, foreign, competitors, are, doing, it;, we're, not, we, cannot, pay, off, $4, trillion, debt, balance, budget, and, have, industries, of, future, and, high-paying, jobs, in, this, country, without, having, revenue, we're, going, to, go, through, a, period, of, shared, sacrifice, there's, one, challenge, it's, got, to, be, fair, we've, created, a, mess, and, don't, have, much, to, show, for, and, we, have, got, to, fix, and, that's, about, all, can, say, in, a, minute, lehrer, okay, next, question, goes, to, bush, for, a, 2-minute, answer, and, will, be, asked, by, sandy, vanocur, u, s, troops, in, europesander, vanocur, this, past, week, your, secretary, of, army, michael, stone, said, he, had, no, plans, to, abide, by, a, congressional, mandate, to, cut, u, s, forces, in, europe, from, 150, 000, to, 100, 000, by, end, of, september, 1996, now, why, almost, 50, years, after, end, of, world, war, i, and, with, total, collapse, of, soviet, union, should, american, taxpayers, be, taxed, support, armies, in, europe, when, europeans, have, plenty, of, money, to, do, for, themselves?, bush, well, sander, that's, a, good, question, and, answer, is, for, 40-some, years, we, kept, peace, if, you, look, at, cost, of, not, keeping, peace, in, europe, would, be, exorbitant, we, have, reduced, number, of, troops, that, are, deployed, and, going, to, be, deployed, have, cut, defense, spending, and, reason, we, could, do, that, is, because, of, our, fantastic, success, in, winning, cold, war, we, never, would, have, got, there, if, we'd, gone, for, nuclear-freeze, crowd;, never, would, have, got, there, if, we'd, listened, to, those, that, wanted, to, cut, defense, spending, think, is, important, that, united, states, stay, in, europe, and, continue, to, guarantee, peace, we, simply, cannot, pull, back, now, when, anybody, has, a, spending, program, they, want, to, spend, money, on, at, home, they, say, well, let's, cut, money, out, of, defense, department, will, accept, and, have, accepted, recommendations, of, two, proven, leaders, general, colin, powell, and, dick, secretary, dick, cheney, they, feel, that, levels, we're, operating, at, and, reductions, that, have, proposed, are, proper, and, so, simply, do, not, think, we, should, go, back, to, isolation, days, and, start, blaming, foreigners, we, are, sole, remaining, superpower, and, we, should, be, that, we, have, a, certain, disproportionate, responsibility, but, would, ask, american, people, to, understand, that, if, we, make, imprudent, cuts, if, we, go, too, far, we, risk, peace, and, don't, want, to, do, that, i've, seen, what, is, like, to, see, burdens, of, a, war, and, don't, want, to, see, us, make, reckless, cuts, because, of, our, programs, we, have, been, able, to, significantly, cut, defense, spending, but, let's, not, cut, into, muscle, and, let's, not, cut, down, our, insurance, policy, which, is, participation, of, american, forces, in, nato, greatest, peacekeeping, organization, ever, made, today, you've, got, problems, in, europe, still, bubbling, along, even, though, europe's, going, democracy's, route, but, we, are, there, and, think, this, insurance, policy, is, necessary, think, goes, with, world, leadership, and, think, levels, we've, come, up, with, are, just, about, right, lehrer, perot, one, minute, sir, perot, if, i'm, poor, and, you're, rich, and, can, get, you, to, defend, me, that's, good, but, when, tables, get, turned, ought, to, do, my, share, right, now, we, spend, about, $300, billion, a, year, on, defense, the, japanese, spend, around, $30, billion, in, asia, the, germans, spend, around, $30, billion, in, europe, for, example, germany, will, spend, a, trillion, dollars, building, infrastructure, over, next, 10, years, it's, kind, of, easy, to, do, if, you, only, have, to, pick, up, a, $30, billion, tab, to, defend, your, country, the, european, community, is, in, a, position, to, pay, a, lot, more, than, they, have, in, past, agree, with, when, they, couldn't, we, should, have;, now, that, they, can, they, should, we, sort, of, seem, to, have, a, desire, to, try, to, stay, over, there, and, control, they, don't, want, us, to, control, very, candidly, so, think, is, very, important, for, us, to, let, them, assume, more, and, more, of, burden, and, for, us, to, bring, that, money, back, here, and, rebuild, our, infrastructure, because, we, can, only, be, a, superpower, if, we, are, an, economic, superpower, and, we, can, only, be, an, economic, superpower, if, we, have, a, growing, expanding, job, base, lehrer, governor, clinton, one, minute, sir, governor, clinton, agree, with, general, statement, bush, made, disagree, that, we, need, 150, 000, troops, to, fulfill, our, role, in, europe, we, certainly, must, maintain, an, engagement, there, there, are, certainly, dangers, there, there, are, certainly, other, trouble, spots, in, world, which, are, closer, to, europe, than, to, united, states, but, two, former, defense, secretaries, recently, issued, reports, saying, that, 100, 000, or, slightly, fewer, troops, would, be, enough, including, reagan's, former, defense, secretary, carlucci, many, of, military, experts, whom, consulted, on, this, agreed, we're, going, to, have, to, spend, more, money, in, future, on, military, technology, and, on, greater, mobility, greater, airlift, greater, sealift, b-22, airplane, we're, going, to, have, to, do, some, things, that, are, quite, costly, and, simply, don't, believe, we, can, afford, nor, do, we, need, to, keep, 150, 000, troops, in, europe, given, how, much, red, army, now, under, control, of, russia, has, been, cut;, arms, control, agreement, concluded, between, bush, and, yeltsin, something, have, applauded, don't, think, we, need, 150, 000, troops, let, me, make, one, other, point, bush, talked, about, taxes, he, didn't, tell, you, that, he, vetoed, a, middle-class, tax, cut, because, would, be, paid, for, by, raising, taxes, on, wealthy, and, vetoed, an, investment, tax, credpaid, for, by, raising, taxes, on, wealthy, taxes, lehrer, all, right, we, go, now, to, perot, for, a, 2-minute, question, and, will, be, asked, by, john, mashek, john, mashek, perot, you, talked, about, fairness, just, a, minute, ago, on, sharing, pain, as, part, of, your, plan, to, reduce, ballooning, federal, defic, you've, suggested, that, we, raise, gasoline, taxes, 50, cents, a, gallon, over, 5, years, why, punish, middle-class, consumer, to, such, a, degree?, perot, it's, 10, cents, a, year, cumulative, it, finally, gets, to, 50, cents, at, end, of, fifth, year, think, \"\"punish\"\", is, wrong, word, again, you, see, didn't, create, this, problem;, we're, trying, to, solve, now, if, you, study, our, international, competitors, some, of, our, international, competitors, collect, up, to, $3, 50, a, gallon, in, taxes, and, they, use, that, money, to, build, infrastructure, and, create, jobs, we, collect, 35, cents, and, we, don't, have, to, spend, know, it's, not, popular, and, understand, nature, of, your, question, but, people, who, will, be, helped, most, by, are, working, people, who, will, get, jobs, created, because, of, this, tax, why, do, we, have, to, do, it?, because, we, have, so, mismanaged, our, country, over, years, and, is, now, time, to, pay, fiddler, and, if, we, don't, we, will, be, spending, our, children's, money, we, have, spent, $4, trillion, worth, an, incredible, number, of, young, people, are, active, in, supporting, my, effort, because, they're, deeply, concerned, that, we, have, taken, american, dream, from, them, think, it's, fitting, that, we're, on, campus, of, a, university, tonight, these, young, people, when, they, get, out, of, this, wonderful, university, will, have, difficulty, finding, a, job, we've, got, to, clean, this, mess, up, leave, this, country, in, good, shape, and, pass, on, american, dream, to, them, we're, got, to, collect, taxes, to, do, if, there's, a, fairer, way, i'm, all, ears, ah-h-h, but, see, let, me, make, very, clear, people, don't, have, stomach, to, fix, these, problems, think, it's, a, good, time, to, face, in, november, if, they, do, then, they, will, have, heard, harsh, reality, of, what, we, have, to, do, i'm, not, playing, lawrence, welk, music, tonight, lehrer, governor, clinton, you, have, a, minute, sir, governor, clinton, think, perot, has, confronted, this, deficissue, but, think, it's, important, to, point, out, that, we, really, have, two, deficits, in, america, not, one, we, have, a, budget, deficin, federal, government, but, we, also, have, an, investment, a, jobs, an, income, defic, people, are, working, harder, for, less, money, than, they, were, making, 10, years, ago, two-thirds, of, our, people, a, $1, 600, drop, in, average, income, in, just, last, 2, years, the, problem, have, with, perot, prescription, is, that, almost, all, economists, who, have, looked, at, say, that, if, you, cut, deficthis, much, this, quick, will, increase, unemployment, will, slow, down, economy, that's, why, think, we, shouldn't, do, that, quickly, we, have, a, disciplined, reduction, in, deficof, 50, percent, over, next, 4, years, but, first, get, incentives, to, invest, in, this, economy, put, american, people, back, to, work, we've, got, to, invest, in, growth, nine, nobel, prize-winning, economists, and, 500, others, including, numerous, republican, and, democratic, business, executives, have, endorsed, this, approach, because, offers, best, hope, to, put, america, back, to, work, and, get, our, incomes, rising, instead, of, falling, lehrer, bush, one, minute, sir, bush, the, question, was, on, fairness, just, disagree, with, perot, don't, believe, is, fair, to, slap, a, 50-cent-a-gallon, tax, over, whatever, many, years, on, people, that, have, to, drive, for, a, living, people, that, go, long, distances, don't, think, we, need, to, do, you, see, have, a, fundamental, difference, agree, with, what, he's, talking, about, in, trying, to, get, spending, down, and, to, discipline, although, think, we, ought, to, totally, exempt, social, security, but, he's, talking, tough, medicine, and, think, that's, good, disagree, with, tax-and-spend, philosophy, you, see, don't, think, we, need, to, tax, more, and, spend, more, and, then, say, that's, going, to, make, problem, better, and, i'm, afraid, that's, what, think, i'm, hearing, from, governor, clinton, believe, what, you, need, to, do, is, some, of, what, ross, is, talking, about, control, growth, of, mandatory, spending, and, get, taxes, down, he's, mentioned, some, ways, to, do, and, agree, with, those, i've, been, talking, about, getting, a, capital, gains, cut, forever, and, his, friends, in, congress, have, been, telling, me, that's, a, tax, break, for, rich, it, would, stimulate, investment, i'm, for, an, investment, tax, allowance, am, for, a, tax, break, for, first-time, homebuyers, and, with, this, new, congress, coming, in, gridlock, will, be, gone, and, i'll, sdown, with, them, and, say, let's, get, this, done, but, do, not, want, to, go, tax-and-spend, route, lehrer, all, right, let's, move, on, now, to, subject, of, jobs, the, first, question, goes, to, bush, for, 2, minutes, and, john, will, ask, that, question, john?the, defense, industry, mashek, last, month, you, came, to, st, louis, to, announce, a, very, lucrative, contract, for, mcdonnell, douglas, to, build, f-15's, for, saudi, arabia, in, today's, post-dispatch, a, retired, saleswoman, a, 75-year-old, woman, named, marjorie, roberts, asked, if, she, could, ask, a, question, of, candidates, said, she, wanted, to, register, her, concern, about, lack, of, a, plan, to, convert, our, defense-oriented, industries, into, other, purposes, how, would, you, answer, her?, bush, well, assume, she, was, supportive, of, decision, on, mcdonnell, douglas, assume, she, was, supporting, me, on, decision, to, sell, those, airplanes, think, it's, a, good, decision, took, a, little, heat, for, but, think, was, correct, decision, to, do, and, we've, worked, out, and, indeed, we're, moving, forward, all, around, world, in, a, much, more, peaceful, way, so, that, one, we, came, away, with, which, --, in, creating, jobs, for, american, people, would, simply, say, to, her, look, take, a, look, at, what, has, proposed, on, job, retraining, when, you, cut, back, on, defense, spending, some, people, are, going, to, be, thrown, out, of, work, if, you, throw, another, 50, 000, kids, on, street, because, of, cutting, recklessly, in, troop, levels, you're, going, to, put, a, lot, more, out, of, work, would, say, to, them, look, at, job, retraining, programs, that, we're, proposing, therein, is, best, answer, to, her, and, another, one, is, stimulate, investment, and, savings, mean, we've, got, big, economic, problems, but, we, are, not, coming, apart, at, seams, we're, ready, for, a, recovery, with, interest, rates, down, and, inflation, down, cruelest, tax, of, all;, caught, up, in, a, global, slowdown, right, now, but, that, will, change, if, you, go, with, programs, i've, talked, about, and, if, you, help, with, job, retraining, and, education, am, a, firm, believer, that, our, america, 2000,
